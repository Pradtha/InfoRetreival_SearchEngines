People know your name here, faculty and administration are accessible, and your success is everyone's priority - all of which makes for an unparalleled student experience.</p>

                <p><strong>Re: <a href="/faculty/contactinfo.cfm?detailid=68021">Rebecca Lonergan</a></strong></p>
                <p>Prof. Rebecca Lonergan was quoted in a story about a San Bernardino County case against a former sheriff's deputy. The man was acquitted on charges related to his shooting of an Air Force enlisted man, but the airman's family has asked the U.S. attorney's office to pursue federal charges. "It is rare for federal authorities to bring the same or similar criminal charges after an acquittal in state court," Lonergan said. "You do have well-established policies in place that there is presumption against filing the same charges federally."</p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich was interviewed on “Hannity & Colmes” about whether former President Bill Clinton is an asset or liability to Sen. Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid. “[P]articularly in a Democratic primary, there is just nobody more popular than Bill Clinton. He’s also a brilliant strategist. So I think he’s only a positive,” Estrich said. “Bill Clinton will not overshadow his wife. If anybody knows how to do the dance exactly right, it’s him.”</p>

                <p>In her “Blue Streak” column, Susan Estrich wrote an assessment of the current wide-open presidential campaign field. This wasn’t the year when you had to declare early or be left out of the game, Estrich wrote. She pointed out that former Sen. Fred Thompson and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg haven’t even declared yet. And there are uncertainties to Sen. John McCain’s run, she added. “McCain’s overtures to the base that cost him the nomination in 2000, in his view, anyway, have cost him the support of the people who almost gave him the nomination in 2000,” Estrich wrote.</p>

Bill Hunt alleged that he was demoted from his position as sheriff’s chief of police in retaliation for comments he made during his failed campaign to become sheriff, the story reported. The department said that Hunt’s comments violated departmental policies governing loyalty, conduct toward superior officers, standards of conduct, the handling of confidential information and dealings with the news media, the article noted. Hunt’s case will come down to the content of his statements and the purpose of the policies the department said he violated, Crayton explained. A policy against insubordination couldn’t be used to punish a candidate for criticizing the department’s leadership because that is at the core of political speech, he added. These policies give managers wide latitude to discipline people they don’t like, Armour said. The policies “are so open-ended, so malleable and subject to discretionary interpretation by the decision maker that they allow almost unbridled room for abuse,” he explained.</p>

But it can’t help you escape the evidence,” Rosenbluth said. She pointed out that actress Winona Ryder and home furnishings maven Martha Stewart had big-money lawyers and both lost their cases. Some say that celebrities tend to serve more time in jail than others convicted of similar offenses because judges don’t wish to appear soft, the story stated. Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca’s county jail system has been so overcrowded that misdemeanor defendants have been serving only 0 percent to 10 percent of their time, Armour said. “Ironically, ... now that the judge put [Hilton] back to serve the remainder of her time, she is serving more time than most.” </p>

                <p>Prof. Alexander Capron was quoted about the moral and medical issues involving the birth of sextuplets to two couples recently. One of women gave birth at 22 weeks, and three of the six babies died soon after, the story noted. One of the couples based the decision to not selectively abort some of the fetuses on religious reasons, according to the story. ”It is always an interesting situation when people rely on modern medicine and talk about God’s will — because if it were simply God’s will, then you’d say, ’If you’re not becoming pregnant, that must be God’s will,” Capron said. Capron is a renowned bioethicist who is co-director of USC’s Pacific Center for Health Policy and Ethics and the author of “Law, Science and Medicine,” the story stated.</p>

                <p>Prof. Simon Wilkie was quoted about government auctions that allocate bandwidth spectrum to telecom companies. There is ongoing debate in Canada about whether the government should conduct open auctions or give preferences to newer companies in the interest of competition, the article reported. By using open auctions to sell its spectrum, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission hasn’t done the best for any involved stakeholders, Wilkie said. “The naive belief that spectrum auctions are always the most efficient and effective solution is wrong,” he continued. “We really need to rethink the fundamentals of auction design.” Wilkie is a former chief economist with the FCC and is executive director of the USC Center for Communication Law and Policy, the story noted.</p>

                <p>Profs. Jody Armour and Jean Rosenbluth were quoted about a judge's decision to return Paris Hilton to jail after her early release by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. "The judge attempted to impose control over the sentence," Armour said. "The sheriff doesn't have discretion to do anything willy-nilly, but once the custody of an inmate has been given over to his department, the sheriff is given a lot of latitude." Rosenbluth said: "Usually the court is very loath to intervene with how the sheriff runs his jail facilities." "But I think because the judge said from the very start no home confinement and 23 days, and the sheriff didn't get his permission ... the judge was quick to assert his control," she explained. Armour was also interviewed on Los Angeles NBC affiliate KNBC-TV about the case. "At the bottom of all of this is a concern about the justice system's reputation for integrity, for administering equal justice to all," Armour said. "And certainly the city attorney's office is very concerned about the perception of a two-tiered system of justice." Armour was also interviewed about Hilton on KABC News and Rosenbluth was also interviewed about Hilton on KNX-Radio.</p>

A year ago, Romney articulated a position on immigration that was similar to that of the new bill, but now he derides it as offering amnesty, Estrich wrote. “Consistency might be the hobgoblin of small minds, but a man who will change his mind about anything is a man who can't be trusted,” she added.

Under expedited removal authority, which was expanded in 2006 to apply to America's entire southwestern border, U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents can immediately deport someone suspected of entering the country illegally, according to the story. "Prior to 1997, that person would have a hearing in front of an immigration judge," Frenzen said. The main concern is that those with legitimate asylum claims might be turned away without proper examination, he added. "People who have the greatest fear of returning sometimes necessarily use false documents to get out of their country," he noted.

                <p>Dean Edward McCaffery’s research on taxing women was cited in an editorial about married women with infants and their decisions to work outside the home. The tax code may encourage women to opt out of the workforce, a trend that a recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report found to be increasing, the story reported. Since the tax code encourages joint filing through lower rates, many couples figure that the “extra” dollars brought in by the wife’s job will be piled onto the husband’s income, resulting in higher tax rates, close to 50 percent, according to estimates by McCaffery.</p>

These standards were created several decades ago in reaction to civil liberties concerns about schizophrenic patients who were locked up indefinitely, the story noted. “The response was to put limits on how long you could hold them,” Saks explained. This trend began in California and eventually spread to other states, she added.</p>

                <p>A story featured volunteer work by four USC Gould School of Law students, who spent their spring break working at Biloxi, Miss., public interest firm the Mississippi Center for Justice. About 550 law students - including 30 from USC - traveled to New Orleans and Biloxi to lend their legal knowledge to firms that needed people to research and gather information from locals affected by Hurricane Katrina, the story reported. The four profiled students conducted interviews and brought information to the organization for use in future class-action lawsuits. “It’s helpful to see how much people who are exploited or left vulnerable by their circumstances can be helped by attorneys,” said Tien Nguyen, one of the students. “That’s something I can take away from that - knowing that we as attorneys can actually make a difference in people’s lives.” This story was carried widely.</p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich  was interviewed on “Talk of the Nation” about the decision by former Sen. John Edwards to continue his presidential campaign despite the return of his wife’s cancer. “When I first heard the news, I think my reaction, like loads of people’s reactions, was.'Why doesn’t he just go home and take care of his wife and be with his family?’” Estrich said. However, “what my friends were telling me who know the Edwardses well, [was that] he was ready to suspend this campaign and it was she who, more than anyone else, convinced him that she wasn’t ready to start dying. She wanted to go on living,” Estrich added. The Edwardses have perhaps the best marriage the public has seen in years, and that’s part of the reason they can do this together, she said. Estrich managed the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and is a syndicated columnist, the story noted.</p>

                <p>Prof. Scott Altman was quoted about the ambiguities of privacy and property rights in cases involving the Internet. A new fee-based wWeb site exposes personal property of celebrity Paris Hilton, reportedly acquired from a storage locker, the story stated. “One of the challenges is that the Internet frequently allows for people other than the wrongdoer to distribute and profit from invasions of privacy,” Altman said. “If someone steals something from Paris Hilton’s locker, and through a series of transactions someone comes to possess something embarrassing or compromising and it ends up on the Internet, it goes everywhere,” he explained. “A third party is always in an ambiguous position as to stolen and compromising goods, but the harm is so much swifter and a greater.” </p>

Testifying can be a scary experience for children, but it can also be a positive experience if the children are given enough support, Lyon said.</p>

                <p>Prof. Edwin Smith was interviewed on “At Issue with Ben Merens” about the Democratic-majority Congress’ plans to withhold Iraq war funding from the Bush administration. “Congress has under the Constitution the power to appropriate all monies,” Smith noted. “It is generally understood that this is the ultimate political power of the Congress.” As yet there hasn’t been a case where a Congress used its power of the purse directly in opposition to an explicitly stated Constitutional presidential power and a president attempted to legally resist, Smith said.</p>

                <p>Prof. John Matsusaka of the USC Initiative & Referendum Institute was interviewed on “Here and Now.” While initiatives generally promoted by conservatives have a history of success at the polls, Tuesday’s this month’s elections brought many exceptions, he said. “The surge of Democratic voters may have tipped these measures down,” he said of marriage and abortion initiatives. Most rejected measures were written in an extreme way, he explained, noting that South Dakota’s failed abortion ban had no exceptions for the health of the mother.</p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich was interviewed about Tuesday’s election results. The gains by Democrats suggest a lack of confidence in President Bush’s policies in Iraq, Estrich said. “Democrats will be in a position to ask questions about the conduct of war in Iraq and to expect the president to begin to come up with some kind of timetable,” she added. However, the implications of the power shift are unclear, she said. “It doesn’t mean that a lot will happen. It may mean that less will happen.” Estrich was the first woman to run a U.S. presidential campaign, for Michael Dukakis in 1988, host Mark Colvin noted.</p>

                <p>Prof. John Matsusaka of the USC Initiative & Referendum Institute was quoted in an article about ballot measures in South Dakota. More than 70 initiatives across the country were citizen-driven, the article noted. Only twice have there been more citizen-driven initiatives since they were first employed in 1902, Matsusaka said. The high number this year may reflect "the general growing dissatisfaction with government and politicians," he added. A story in The Florida Times-Union also cited the Initiative and Referendum Institute's finding that there were a near-record number of citizen-driven initiatives this year.</p>

                <p>Prof. John Matsusaka of the USC Initiative & Referendum Institute was interviewed on “Talk of the Nation” about Tuesday’s numerous ballot initiatives during the Nov. 7 elections. The many minimum wage initiatives promoted by progressive groups were a concerted effort to bring out voters and change Washington, Matsusaka said. In addition, the many marriage initiatives may have brought out African American voters, who generally oppose same-sex marriage but support Democrats, he added. “[This] may be surprising for many people, but it could very well be the truth,” Matsusaka said. “We do know that opposition to gay marriage is strongest amongst the African American community. Now what it actually did in terms of the actual votes is in dispute.”</p>

                <p>Prof. Ronald Garet was quoted in an article about a Kansas attorney general candidate’s practice of campaigning in churches. Churches are under increasing scrutiny for mixing politics and religion, and the blurring of the lines is going on at both ends of the political spectrum, he said. The candidate’s strategy of holding campaign rallies with congregants outside the traditional worship service may not violate the law, but it’s a subtle difference, Garet added.</p>

                <p>Prof. John Matsusaka of the USC Initiative and Referendum Institute was quoted about the financial battle over Proposition 87, which would tax oil production in California to fund alternative energy development. A total of $107 million has been raised to date by the rival camps: oil companies versus a coalition of environmentalists and venture capitalists. “This is a huge amount of money,” Matsusaka said. “Bush and Kerry spent $250 million for a national election. This measure is costing nearly half that for a local issue in one state.” He added that Big Oil “is trying to signal to anyone else contemplating similar measures that if you’re going to take on the industry, you are going to have to spend a ton of money.”</p>

The IRS has every right to make sure nonprofits abide by the rules pertaining to political nonalignment, but the sermon in question doesn’t come anywhere near the legal definition of picking sides, McCaffery said. 
“This is completely ridiculous, what the IRS is doing,” he added. McCaffery was also quoted about the case in a Pasadena Star-News story.</p>

                <p>Prof. Michael Shapiro was quoted in a story about free samples from prescription drug companies. The samples can be a boon to poor patients, said Shapiro, an expert on bioethics. “Physicians keep free samples around particularly earmarked for patients and their families who are financially strapped. It’s a way for drug redistribution. It’s maybe not the best way, but it’s one way,” he noted.</p>

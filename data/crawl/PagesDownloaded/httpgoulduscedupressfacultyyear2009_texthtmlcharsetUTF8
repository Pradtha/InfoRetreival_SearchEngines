                <p>Prof. Edward Kleinbard was interviewed about capping tax expenditures to reduce the federal deficit. The government does without roughly a trillion dollars a year because of tax breaks -- everything from the mortgage-interest deduction, to education and child credits, to low rates on investments. Those breaks can translate into higher tax rates and a federal budget that is much bigger than advertised, according to Kleinbard.</p>

                <p>Prof. Daria Roithmayr was interviewed about  Elena Kagan’s confirmation hearing to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. She will likely have to address a 1995 review she wrote of Stephen Carter's book The Confirmation Mess—many court watchers concur with the thrust of her thesis. "There's very little incentive for the nominee to say anything more than what is needed to pass the confirmation process," said Roithmayr. "Since the Robert Bork hearings, the task of the nominee is simply not to say anything disqualifying." </p>

                <p>Prof. Edward McCaffery was quoted about the concept of voluntary taxes. “To get bigger dollars out of it, I think you need bigger changes in consciousness,” said McCaffery. “That might be a two-way street. People aren’t going to do it more until they have more faith in government. But people aren’t going to have more faith in government until they feel they have more stake and agency.” Perhaps eventually, “We could be a different kind of society where we didn’t think of government in such adversarial terms,” McCaffery says. “Things could snowball, you’d have a virtuous cycle.” But, he adds, “You still have the possibility of government blowing that trust.”</p>

African Americans’ claims against their own government and domestic institutions are not diminished even by proof positive that African traders understood the horrors to which they were dispatching ‘fellow Africans.’ Efforts to call the U.S. government to account for the legally sanctioned and supported enslavement of millions of human beings rest on the history of slavery and its aftermath right here on U.S. shores.” Her piece also ran on the American Constitution Society website.

                <p>Prof. Niels Frenzen about the relationship between international and U.S. law. “The general rule is that provisions of international laws are not self-executing within the USA absent an implementing domestic law. So the opinions of the UN experts cannot be enforced or given any legal effect within the U.S.,” said Frenzen.  “They are certainly powerful opinions which convey the growing international condemnation of the Arizona laws and their statements and opinions strengthen the political opposition to what Arizona has done.”</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was interviewed about the Pasadena Playhouse, which recently filed for bankruptcy. Rasmussen said that every bankruptcy case is different, but the Playhouse's future will hinge on whether the business can make money.   "The real question is whether there is an assumption that you can still be profitable on the part of the creditors," Rasmussen said. If not, he said, the assets of the group are sold off and creditors take what they can get.

Klerman said he doesn't consider Kagan’s lack of judicial experience a problem. In fact, he said, it's useful to have judges with a range of experiences.  Having someone who has served as Solicitor General, as dean of a law school and who has advised U.S. Presidents as Kagan has is "extremely useful experience for a Supreme Court nominee, and she'll learn all she needs to about judging in a year or two," he said.</p>

                <p>Prof. Niels Frenzen was quoted about the use of the word “amnesty” by Republican California gubernatorial candidates Steve Poizner and Meg Whitman. Frenzen questioned both candidates’ throwing around the word “amnesty.” He said no proposal for a blanket legalization for people in the country illegally has gained any traction in Congress since President Ronald Reagan  signed the 1986 immigration reform law. “I know that any type of immigration reform is immediately characterized by opponents of immigration reform as having an amnesty component,” Frenzen said. “If the definition of amnesty is forgiving without penalty, there has not been any amnesty that’s been proposed in recent years.”</p>

While such jousting appears to be motivated by power and fees, "there could be an underlying basis" for conflict of interest concerns, said Keating. The two different types of claims might proceed on different theories of liability - breach of warranty for economic loss and defective condition for personal injury, which could result in differing theories of liability and damages, Keating said.

                <p>Prof. Rebecca Lonergan was quoted about disputes between medical marijuana dispensaries and L.A. city attorneys. She said that prosecuting the case against a dispensary with several criminal violations may be a legal tactic by the city to dissuade the opening of more facilities. "This case is just one more step in a long battle between the marijuana dispensaries in the L.A. area and city attorneys, so I'm not sure that this particular case will have a necessary effect," said Lonergan. "(The city is) trying to make an example, sure. You've got hundreds of these popping up all over the county, so they're setting these up to a couple of cases as a deterrent to say `Stop this."' </p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich wrote an opinion piece about retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. Estrich recalled serving as a clerk for Stevens in the 1970s. "The petition came in around 9 p.m. on May 24, 1979. A man named John Spenkelink, convicted in the murder of a fellow hitchhiker in Florida, was scheduled to die that night, and he was fighting to the end," Estrich wrote. "Years later, I talked about that night with Justice Stevens. He had lost faith in the fairness of the death penalty, because no one paid the kind of attention that he had, and Justice Stewart had, and Justice Marshall had, that night long ago. When I asked him why he had changed, he told me that on this, as on so many questions, he had not changed at all. The court had."</p>

                <p>Prof. Gillian Hadfield was interviewed about the dismal job outlook for law students graduating this year and those who graduated in 2009. Hadfield said law firms are responding to a push back from clients who do not see the value of using first- and second-year associates on their matters. And, she said, law schools need to examine how to produce attorneys who are valuable to clients. "What a lot of firms are facing is real structural changes going on in the market," Hadfield said. "A lot of large corporate clients are pushing back on a lot of things. This is... about the pressure to reduce costs, improve efficiency, increase value."</p>

The researchers proposed that voters be offered more information on the ballot itself, the story noted.</p>

                <p>A case that was taken on by USC Law’s Post-Conviction Justice Project, involving a woman who defenders believe was wrongfully convicted of murder, was featured. Few inmates maintain their innocence throughout their incarceration, something that client Rosie Sanchez did, said Prof. Michael Brennan. USC Law student Jennifer Farrell helped to secure the woman's release by convincing Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to defer to the parole board's decision to release her. "When you're innocent, you can express remorse for the victim, but no insight," Farrell said. "Rosie thought about just saying that she did it, making up reasons for why. But she decided not to lie. If she gave up on the truth, she wouldn't have anything left." Napa Valley Register also covered the story.</p>

"The United States stands largely alone in advanced-market democracies in drastically restricting where and how people can get help with their legal problems," Hadfield wrote. "In all states, under rules created by bar associations and state supreme courts, only people with law degrees and who are admitted to the state bar can provide legal advice and services of any kind. In England, Australia and the Netherlands, by contrast, a wide variety of professionals and experts can provide legal assistance."</p>

                <p>Prof. Edward Kleinbard was interviewed about government tax breaks. Even though tax breaks lower the tax bite for eligible individuals and corporations, they end up raising taxes on others. "Targeted tax relief is just another name for government spending, in which taxes extracted from those of us who are not targeted fund hidden spending on those who are," said Kleinbard.</p>

The study reviewed the bundling of corporate mergers with a move to a staggered board structure. For the first time, empirical evidence exists that corporate management - to obtain outcomes it wants - bundles charter amendments that might be unfavorable to shareholders with measures that enjoy shareholder support, Kamar and Bebchuk found.</p>

                <p>It was reported that a re-enactment of the U.S. Supreme Court hearings on the legal challenge to Proposition 8 is being filmed in a mock courtroom at USC Law. AOL News noted that Prof. David Cruz of the Gould School is advising the production on the scripts and the dynamics of a trial. "Few people are going to have the time and patience to read through the voluminous transcripts -- almost 1,300 pages just in the first week of trial," Cruz wrote on his USC Web page, the story noted. "Being able to play the re-enactment on the Web will increase exposure, which in the end can only help the cause of equality under law." The story was also covered by The Washington Post, in a widely carried Associated Press story, and CBS News Pittsburgh affiliate KDKA-TV.</p>

"Gang injunctions are a mixed bag," Griffith said. "There are at least two problems: It is not a crime to belong to a gang, and people can be placed on the gang database improperly. There is no due process," he added. "I prefer not to criminalize legal behavior. Two gang members could be arrested for riding in a car to see 'Avatar.'"</p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich wrote an op-ed about opponents of health care reform who are using federalism as an argument against federal government regulation. "Now, you can't keep telling me that health care is the biggest economic issue -- 1/6 of our economy and all that -- and then turn around and say there's not enough of a connection to interstate commerce to require 20-year-olds to have insurance. I can introduce you to some. They are forces of interstate commerce, and as every parent knows, they are not immortal. They get hurt. They get sick. They should have insurance. If that's the worst thing the nanny state ever does to all of us, I'd say a gracious thanks," Estrich wrote.</p>

"The frightening part of the latest directive adding to the list of those warranting special scrutiny individuals who either are from or have been traveling in countries known to harbor terrorists is not that it unfairly profiles, but that we haven't been doing that kind of screening up to this point," Estrich wrote. "We can do everything reasonable to provide the security and stability that may reduce the attractions of radical ideology. But where it has already taken root, our only option is to root it out and destroy the threat. We will not do so successfully if we're all wasting our time fidgeting with the clasp of an antique gold bracelet."</p>

"There is only one number that matters right now, and that number is 60. Anything that would cost the Democrats 60 votes will have to go. The perfect is the enemy of the possible. The possible is the art of politics. This is not about getting a perfect bill -- just one that can pass."</p>

                <p>Prof. Edward Kleinbard was quoted about proposed legislation that would ensure no lapse in the estate tax, by being implemented retroactively should it be approved. Kleinbard said that any court challenges against the IRS alleging that the tax violates the constitutional ban against ex post facto laws wouldn't hold up in court and that it would be hard for an individual to claim that he or she relied on current law, since the repeal is only scheduled to be in effect for one year. "When it comes to the estate tax, the reliance argument is just silly, because we don't plan our death around estate tax schedules," Kleinbard said.</p>

"Once the voters make up their minds on an issue, they feel irked if people prod them again." The story also cited the University of Southern California College of Letters, Arts and Sciences/Los Angeles Times Poll, which showed that 60 percent of voters do not want to see the gay marriage issue back on the ballot in November.</p>

"While certain things may be true as a matter of 'public health' -- like the costs of early mammograms outweighing their benefits -- that doesn't mean they're true for you. The White House was quick to point out that this week's recommendation does not mean doctors should stop sending women for mammograms, or that insurance companies will be allowed to stop paying for them.

But for those students interested in theory, there will be ample opportunity to take theoretical courses as well,” Prof. Thomas Griffith said. “The way we’re approaching the tax LLM program is that the JD program is an extremely important foundation in critical thinking and in exposure to both doctrine and trends in academic thought, but is not itself tantamount to preparation for being a successful tax practitioner the day one finishes law school,” Prof. Edward Kleinbard said. “To me, tax is too important to leave to the people who understand it.

                <p>Prof. John Matsusaka was quoted about lawsuits that would block an effort to place Native American gaming compacts before voters. Matsusaka said the interpretation put forward by the tribes -- that a reading of the constitution requires proponents of a referendum not only to collect the requisite number of signatures but also to have them verified within 90 days -- doesn't make sense given the reasons behind Californians adopting the referendum process back in 1911. "The spirit of the referendum is to allow voters to challenge the government, and if you allow the government to nullify a referendum simply by slow verification, which you could do, you essentially rob it of its purpose," Matsusaka said.</p>

Spectacular doesn't begin to describe his fundraising skills. There was, for all intents and purposes, no endowment before him. He was also the most enthusiastic salesman and promoter of a university that I've ever seen. He cut the size of the freshman class, raised the standards, started giving out merit scholarships to the top students, vastly expanded the faculty, rewarded entrepreneurship of the academic variety, and unleashed an explosion of energy and innovation on campus," she wrote.

"Yet, everyone you talk to has an opinion about the distribution of vaccine this flu season. And I've yet to hear too many good ones. I'm sure there are plenty of people and entities to blame for what's gone wrong. But since the government is very obviously running the show when it comes to the distribution of vaccine, it's not exactly a reassuring introduction to some kind of 'public option.'"</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was quoted in an article on developers of downtown Los Angeles buildings either losing control of their properties or going into bankruptcy. Rasmussen said that in the current economic climate, lenders may be more likely to cooperate with borrowers on a reorganization or alternate payment plan than they had been in the past. "If the bank does foreclose, it has to find a new buyer, and the bank isn't structured to finish the development itself, so it would much prefer a consensual agreement if it can reach one," he noted.</p>

"Greider was a 23-year-old graduate student at Berkeley when, on Christmas Day in 1984, she made the discovery that led to this prize. She was working for a woman who had been trained by a man who believed in supporting women. This is not really complicated," Estrich wrote. "Women succeed the same way men do. Someone gives them a chance. One of the most depressing trends I have encountered of late is women my age, women in their 40s, 50s and 60s, who are unwilling to help the younger women coming into our professions, resentful that it is easier for them than it was for us, dismissive of their desires to balance work and life with greater freedom than we had."</p>

In 2003, Matsusaka found that no more than a third of California's appropriations that year were locked in by voter initiatives so stringent that legislators couldn't override them. Matsusaka found that only about 2 percent or 3 percent of California's budget is frozen as a result of ballot initiatives. The story stated that Matsusaka's analysis was affirmed last month by the Legislative Analyst's Office, a nonpartisan group that advises the Legislature, which found that despite the proposition restrictions, the legislature maintains considerable control over the state budget.</p>

"The difficulty of course is that there are all sorts of reasons why victims won't cooperate that aren't really in the interests of the state to acknowledge."

Estrich spoke about her own experience as a rape victim. "My heart goes out to this woman and her desire to make this all go away," Estrich said. "As a matter of fact, most of us who've been raped in one way or another want to close our eyes and make it go away. But rape isn't a crime against the victim. It's a crime against the state. To be a fugitive from justice is as serious a crime as the underlying rape offense."</p>

In California and Maryland, where the group made the videos, it is illegal to record a conversation unless everyone involved is aware of the recording, Lerner said. "If I'm sitting at a table talking to two people about their tax information and no one else can hear that, the person who recorded that could have a problem," Lerner said. ACORN likely has a criminal case and a civil case against the bloggers, according to Lerner and Spitzer. "There's a section of civil code that basically requires people to be informed and consent to being recorded," Spitzer said.</p>

"It sounds like a major step until you read the fine print: The biggest tobacco companies don't even make these cigarettes; the folks who did, seeing the handwriting on the wall, had pretty much stopped after Congress acted; and the ban doesn't touch menthol, the most popular flavor. So will banning flavored cigarettes that made up some 1 percent of the market stop teenagers from opening the door to addiction? I wouldn't bet on it."</p>

Chasalow said there are three basic steps that need to be taken when setting up a business. The first is to incorporate the business, because otherwise the owner will have personal liability. The second is to have a shareholder's agreement. "People say, 'We always get along; we don't need an agreement.' I can't tell you how many times I've seen people who get along and then five minutes later they're not speaking to each other," Chasalow said. The third is to divide ownership fairly. "It's important to do this when you're on good terms and being fair and reasonable to each other," Chasalow advised.</p>

The idea is that this measure would encourage workers to buy less comprehensive plans to avoid paying tax on some of their employer's contribution, the story stated. "Over time, the tax bite will be deeper," Kleinbard said, referring to health care costs rising faster than inflation.</p>

Kleinbard, who was chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in May when committee members discussed incorporating regional variations into a cap on the income tax exclusion for employer-provided insurance, said he thought tax writers could craft a constitutional bill, but he added that a state-based strategy would miss important variations within states.</p>

Saks was recognized for her scholarly work in mental health law and her memoir, "The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness," which documents her struggles with schizophrenia. In an Associated Press story in The New York Times, Saks said that the money will allow her to continue educating people about the lives of those with severe mental illness. "I want to make a difference in how people see schizophrenia," she explained. "I hope my book and other books like it give people more understanding and more sympathy and more empathy." Saks is currently working on a book about high-functioning people with schizophrenia, the story noted. The news was also covered by The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, Inside Higher Ed, The Boston Globe, KPCC-FM, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, the Jewish Journal and Fox News Nashville, Tenn., affiliate WZTV-TV.</p>

                <p>Prof. David Cruz was quoted in an article on proposed ballot initiatives to amend California's constitution to allow same-sex marriage. "There's no limit to the number of times the California constitution can be amended, or amended on a particular topic," Cruz said. He added that marriage equality proponents could speed up the process in what could potentially be a decades-long battle over same-sex marriage, by pushing a ballot initiative that would limit ballot initiatives. However, this would require spending the money and time to pass two initiatives instead of one.</p>

The program is designed to attract working professionals who plan to specialize, particularly in light of the tight job market, Dean Robert Rasmussen said. "We sat down with partners at law firms and asked: What do they value? What do they see that is more likely for them to hire someone? The one thing they talked about is the tax LL.M," Rasmussen said. "I think tax is a very complex and specialized field. Tax lawyers are always in demand. You would think our tax code would be changed, both in California and the federal government, which both have budget crises. And it's reasonable to conjecture one response to the crises is [that] they'll amend the respective tax codes one way or the other. That will continue to increase the demand for tax lawyers."</p>

                <p>USC Law’s new graduate program in tax law, which makes USC Law the only top 20 law school on the West Coast to offer an LL.M. degree in taxation, was featured. "We have a great tax community in Los Angeles ... . We're going to draw on that community," Dean Robert Rasmussen said. "Any time you can get a program like this in a major legal market, that program is going to have a great quality." Rasmussen added that taxation is a strong suit for USC Law, which has leading tax faculty and a long-running annual tax institute. Deborah Call, associate dean of graduate and international programs, pointed out that because only six of the top 20 law schools offer tax LL.M. programs, many of California's tax attorneys have sought degrees outside the state; by establishing its own tax law program, USC Law will serve as a geographically accessible, top-tier choice for lawyers looking for tax expertise. The school's tax scholars include Elizabeth Garrett, Edward McCaffery, Edward Kleinbard and Thomas Griffith, the story noted. Students may begin applying next month for full- or part-time enrollment in fall 2010, the article reported. </p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich wrote a widely carried op-ed about departing Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton. She recalled meeting him early in his career, when she was leading a series of meetings with top police. Bratton, though initially skeptical of new research on ways to identify violent predators, later warmed to modern techniques and brought them to L.A., Estrich stated. “He brought new technology that puts resources where crime is greatest, where they are needed and not necessarily where the politically powerful people live,” she wrote.</p>

Dean Robert Rasmussen said: “I just finished my second year as dean of USC and, in doing that, I thought: What can we at USC do better than anyone else in the world? One thing we can do better, given who we are and where we are, is entertainment law.” Schulman said he envisions a program with practical experience, with mock trials or clinics. The program will include entertainment law and classes from the USC School of Cinematic Arts and the USC Marshall School, the story noted.</p>

In one 1977 case, activists attempted to stop the killing of baby seals by arguing that the loss of seals caused aesthetic and educational damage to people. “The seals are being bludgeoned to death and somebody’s saying, ‘I want to be seeing seals.’ That’s not what it’s about,” Stone observed.</p>

The article reported that there are roughly 150 unreleased Jackson songs, but that it’s unclear whether the rights belong to Sony, whose Epic Records label produced Jackson’s last original albums. Once Jackson’s estate is out of the contract with Sony, it would have wide latitude to distribute Jackson’s music how it wishes, even doing so without a music label, Grode said.</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was quoted about Michael Jackson’s estate and his children’s inheritance. “You have to pay your creditors before you can pay your children,” Rasmussen said. “That’s Law 101.” The story also quoted Vice Dean Scott Altman about Debbie Rowe, the mother of Jackson’s older children. “[I]f Rowe has been visiting pretty regularly — if they think of her as a mother and have an ongoing personal, intimate relationship with her — then she could probably succeed in getting custody,” Altman said.</p>

                <p>Prof. Lance Grode, who worked at the law firm that brokered Michael Jackson’s acquisition of the Sony-ATV music catalog, was quoted about its earning potential. “Certain catalogs are considered prizes. There’s nothing like them in the world in terms of generating licenses and income,” Grode said. “The Sony-ATV catalog, it’s going to be exploited forever.” This story was carried widely.</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was interviewed on “Marketplace” about Neverland Ranch’s prospects as a tourist attraction. “Graceland I don’t think is a good parallel, in the sense that at least [with] Graceland we always knew that was Elvis’ house, that’s where Elvis would retreat to, that’s where Elvis lived,” Rasmussen said. “Michael Jackson hasn’t lived in Neverland for years. Neverland I think is has a bit more checkered persona than Graceland did.”</p>

                <p>Prof. Edward McCaffery was interviewed on “The Situation Room” about the possibility that Michael Jackson’s children are not biologically his. This would matter if there is no valid will, McCaffery said. “If there is a valid will, the Is were dotted, the Ts were crossed, no fraud, no suspicious circumstances, Michael Jackson could leave his estate to his neighbor,” McCaffery pointed out. “But if there is not a valid will, or if there’s conflicts, there could be a question,” he added.</p>

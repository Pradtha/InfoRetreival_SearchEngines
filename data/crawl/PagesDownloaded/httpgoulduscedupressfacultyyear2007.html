<p>From your first day on campus you'll notice USC Gould is different. It's small enough to be a community in the real sense of the word even though USC is one the country's largest research universities, and located in the second largest city in the United States. People know your name here, faculty and administration are accessible, and your success is everyone's priority - all of which makes for an unparalleled student experience.</p>

                <p>Prof. Michael Shapiro was quoted about a videotape showing staff at King-Harbor hospital ignoring a dying patient. “Many times, people... think, ‘If I keel over, I’m in a hospital, people will take care of me,’” Shapiro said. But that’s not necessarily true, he noted. Such incidents happen more often than people think, he added. “I think it reflects deficiencies in the human character,” he added. Shapiro is a bioethics expert, the story noted.</p>

Obama’s popularity amongst younger voters could have implications for the vote, Cruz said. “If there is a high turnout of young voters in November, that is likely to favor supporters of same-sex marriage,” he explained. “Polls have consistently shown that younger voters are not opposed to it,” he added. “It’s unheard of in the state of California ... to have voters amend the constitution to try to take away something that the state’s highest court has held to be a fundamental right and to take it away from a historically disadvantaged social minority,” Cruz said in a Chicago Tribune story.</p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich of was quoted about selecting a vice presidential candidate. Many names will go on and off the lists of potential running mates, but only those with the cleanest records and the most fortitude will make the short list, Estrich said. “You never know the details of someone’s life until they get on the vice presidential list and then you know more than you want to know,” she explained. The choice is based not on who is the best pal but who can help the ticket, she added.

Estrich was campaign manager for Michael Dukakis in 1988, the story noted.</p>

                <p>Prof. David Cruz was interviewed on San Francisco affiliate KCBS-AM about the letter brief of 10 states’ attorneys general urging the California Supreme Court to stay its decision on same-sex marriages. "The states had no formal legal standing to seek a stay and were simply offering their views as interested non-parties to the case," Cruz said.</p>

None of the judges hearing the case has a track record in this area of law, because there’s never been a case like it, Lonergan said. This is cutting edge, she said.

                <p>Prof. David Cruz was quoted about the long-term results of California’s overturn of a same-sex marriage ban. The U.S. Supreme Court waited for more than a decade to strike down laws banning interracial marriage after it had declared racial segregation to be "inherently unequal" and a violation of the Constitution in 1954, Cruz noted. The legal outcome in terms of same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court probably depends on the "tide of public opinion,” he added.</p>

                <p>Prof. David Cruz was quoted about the California Supreme Court ruling that overturned a same-sex marriage ban. The court has been asked to consider delaying the implementation of the ruling until voters have considered a constitutional amendment that would make such marriages illegal, the story stated. But the court is unlikely to grant the motion, because it was well aware of the ballot measure when it made its decision, Cruz said. “With the prospect of almost six months of same-sex couples getting married, continuing their daily lives throughout the state, letting people see that their lives haven’t changed, the sky hasn’t fallen and loving relationships have strengthened - that would make it unlikely the ballot measure would pass,” Cruz added. If the measure does pass, it’s likely that any marriages performed between now and November would be nullified, Cruz said in a San Francisco Chronicle story. Cruz was also quoted in the Ventura County Star.</p>

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has good policies and systems on paper, but it isn’t implementing those systems in any way, Frenzen said.</p>

As an undocumented immigrant from Belize, Anthony initially was ineligible to apply for financial aid to go to college. Anthony applied for and received U.S. residency before transferring to USC. Among her awards and recognitions was Public Interest Law Foundation Student of the Year in 2008. She also has worked for the Post Conviction Justice Project and helped the NAACP Gulf Coast Advocacy Center provide legal help to victims of Hurricane Katrina. “She has a genuine passion for social justice,” said Prof. Thomas Griffith. “She’s going to be an amazing public defender.” Anthony and her graduation story also appeared on KCOP-News.</p>

Lonergan told the Los Angeles Times that applying the statute in this case is a stretch. "This is an extremely aggressive prosecution," she said.

                <p>Prof. Elyn Saks and her memoir about living with schizophrenia were highlighted in a story on increasing candor regarding mental illness. Saks is among those whose frank talk is part of a conversation about mental illness taking place across the country, the story stated. Saks said she hopes to help others in her position find tolerance, especially those with fewer resources. “I have the kind of life that anybody, mentally ill or not, would want: a good place to live, nice friends, loved ones,” she said. “For an unlucky person, I’m very lucky.”</p>

“While Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton continued to fight it out for the Democratic nomination on Tuesday, John McCain was waging a fight of his own within his party, for the support of the hard-core Republican base who aren¹t quite sure they trust the man who discussed running with John Kerry in 2004 and reportedly told Arianna Huffington that he didn’t vote for George Bush in 2000,” Estrich wrote. “[T]here he was, pandering for the support of those who have scorned him in the past, and saying not one word to support the image of independence he is sure to cultivate in the fall.”</p>

In 1982, Democratic officials decided to make sure that a sizable percentage of delegates to the 1984 convention would be uncommitted PLEOs (“party leaders elected officials”). “I wrote a column as well as a memo using the term super-delegates ‹ I don’t know if/how I made it up or not ‹ the idea was to be derogatory, to suggest that the super-delegates would hold more power than the equally divided pledged convention delegates,’ said Estrich, who opposed the creation of such delegates.

                <p>Prof. Gillian Hadfield wrote an op-ed about the settlements that most families of Virginia Tech shooting victims accepted in lieu of litigation. “The impulse to avoid litigation is increasingly widespread in American society,” Hadfield wrote. “The impulse is troublesome. The real issues at stake in the trend to wholesale lawsuit avoidance are about democracy and the critical role that courts play in achieving the ideals of self-government in a public, accessible and open forum. When things go wrong, those who have suffered losses want to know what happened, who did or did not do their jobs and how the problems will be fixed in the future.”</p>

                <p>A study by Prof. Edward McCaffery was featured. After surveying 3,300 people via phone and the Internet, McCaffery and a colleague found that men tolerated hypothetical discrimination more than women did. "Many political struggles of our time, in the United States as elsewhere, amount to clashes over the appropriate boundary between permissible and impermissible forms of discrimination," McCaffery said. "We have found that, while discrimination in its traditional forms - based on race and gender - may be receding somewhat, discrimination in other domains, as based on appearance, persists. Here we found that people are more willing to accept discrimination against poorly educated immigrants, for example, than so-called genetic discrimination. Men are more willing to accept discrimination, but both men and women converge when we did a telephone survey and there was a live interviewer - women became more, and men less, openly tolerant of discrimination."</p>

                <p>Prof. Thomas Griffith was quoted about a Web site that allows people to rate the performance of police officers. While similar systems for rating teachers or restaurants are fine, it’s different when applied to police officers, Griffith said. People can’t choose their officers, as they do with teachers or restaurants, Griffith noted. “A mechanism with unconfirmed reports that can be over-praising or condemning is not the best way to ensure accountability,” he explained.</p>

                <p>Prof. Thomas Lyon was quoted about a child custody case that may include charges of abuse. “Judges are pretty cautious about abuse charges in a custody case,” Lyon said. “Making allegations can make the accuser look vindictive, and lead to judicial backlash,” he added. Lyon is a law professor and psychologist who has investigated custody cases for the county and argued as a lawyer in family courts, the story noted.</p>

                <p>Associate Dean Greg Keating was quoted about a case involving an ex-convict, employed by a church, who attacked a woman. The woman’s family has filed a negligence suit against the church for not informing the surrounding community of the convict’s presence. The case raises interesting legal questions, Keating said. “You could say, ‘We have a charitable institution and if we impose these restrictions, they won't provide these services [to ex-convicts] and these people will be out on the street,” Keating said. “The counterargument is, ‘Why is the cost on the woman?’”</p>

The initiative’s original backers urged voters to reject the measure, saying the problem it aimed to address was already solved, the story reported. “It demonstrates that there should be a mechanism to pull things off the ballot,” Matsusaka said. “If a group doesn’t want its initiative anymore, it should just be allowed to pull it.”</p>

An Obama-McCain faceoff would be “the fresh young voice of unity and hope versus the slightly cynical Straight Talk Express in a battle for the independents,” Roithmayr said. On the other hand, a McCain-Clinton battle represents “a much more standard matchup” and “all of the energy, I think, goes out of the election,” she added.</p>

"What ICE has done is file a second round of motions to change venue," Frenzen said. "To suggest the government filed the motions, but it is the immigration judges who decide, is ridiculous. The government is getting two bites at the apple."  Frenzen said immigration officials lost their bid to move his client's case to South Texas but refused to bring the immigrant back to California.

The other defendants want a severance so their trials won't be delayed.

But it can be difficult for patients to find these kinds of records on doctors, and celebrity patients can be at greater risk because they often go to doctors who are famous rather than skilled, she added. “We need more information, more readily accessible, about who is safe and who is dangerous,” Estrich wrote.</p>

"There is not a minute that goes by that some federal agent or federal prosecutor or law enforcement figure somewhere is not being lied to by someone," she said. "What the government tends to do is not prosecute perjury unless it's a high-profile case. You can send the message out worldwide saying, 'Do not lie to us.' Barry Bonds is a perfect example."

                <p>A story featured Street Law, a community initiative of the USC Gould School, in which law students teach classes to K-12 students in order to generate interest in the legal profession. Street Law started at USC in 1992 after the Los Angeles riots. After being inactive for some time, the program was revived earlier this year by second-year Gould School student Irene Lee, the article reported. Lee worked on the initiative with a vice president of a Sony subsidiary and the Los Angeles Unified School District’s (LAUSD) assistant general counsel, as well as fellow Gould students, and arranged class visits sponsored by the Association for Corporate Counsel. The group has so far focused on the James A. Foshay Learning Center, which is part of the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative.  “The plan was to get five to 10 law students to do the teaching,” Lee said.  “But 40 students showed up. I thought it was because of the free pizza. But they’ve stuck around.” This year, the USC students and corporate counsel taught classes on contracts, sports and entertainment law, and school law, culminating in a school-uniform presentation by a Foshay student. All Foshay students who have participated in the Neighborhood Academic Initiative graduated from high school, compared with 66 percent across LAUSD, and 91 percent have enrolled in higher education, the story reported.</p>

                <p>Louis Galen, a USC alumnus, trustee, donor and namesake of USC’s Galen Center, was remembered in an obituary. “Lou’s legacy will live on through the many buildings and programs that bear the Galen name,” said USC President Steven B. Sample. Galen, with his wife, Helene, gave a series of gifts totaling $50 million for the Galen Center, a 10,258-seat sports-and-entertainment arena. “Galen never played sports for USC, but his enthusiasm for the university’s teams started when he was a boy, when he worked at the Coliseum as a hot dog vendor at Trojan football games,” the story stated. “I loved it because you couldn’t sell during the games, so we had to sit and watch,” Galen told The Hollywood Reporter last year. Years later, Galen proposed to Helene in front of 3,000 people at a USC-Notre Dame football rally, and he presented her with a Trojan marching band helmet on their wedding day. “In all my years as a college coach, I’ve never seen anybody who gave more, who lived for their school more, who was more interested in the future after he left this Earth than Lou,” said USC Head Men’s Basketball Coach Tim Floyd.

The number of citizen's initiatives was down slightly because next year's presidential election will draw far more voters, Matsusaka said. "These votes were not particularly definitive in telling us much about the American electorate as a whole, but did give indications as to what individual states were wrestling with," he added.</p>

                <p>Prof. Alexander Capron was quoted about a proposed California law that would make it a misdemeanor for a hospital to transport patients anywhere other than their residences without their informed consent. The proposed legislation arose in response to recent "homeless dumping" cases in which hospitals allegedly left homeless patients on L.A.'s Skid Row. Legal experts have questioned the proposal, the story stated. It could render hospitals liable for actions that go far beyond their treatment of the homeless, Capron said. "If someone lives in a one-room flophouse alone, would that even be an appropriate discharge under this law and to what extent would a hospital be responsible?" he asked.</p>

                <p>Prof. Heidi Rummel was interviewed about the mistrial in the Phil Spector case. She said that it was very likely that the 10-2 split was in favor of conviction. She said the DA’s office had the right to retry the case and would likely consider the jurors’ feedback and the seriousness of the charges in making that decision.  She also said that there was the possibility of a manslaughter plea which would represent a compromise by both sides.</p>

                <p>USC Law Professors Jean Rosenbluth, Jody Armour and Michael Brennan were quoted in stories about the jury impasse in the Phil Spector murder trial. Prof. Rosenbluth was quoted in a widely carried Reuters article: “I don’t recall hearing of a case in which the jury indicated they were hung and told they could consider another charge.” She told Bloomberg News: “The prosecution might welcome the possibility of a lesser offense.” Rosenbluth also discussed the case for two Los Angeles Times stories, Court TV, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, Los Angeles Daily News, CTV (Canadian Television), Kyoto News, Larry Mantle’s “Air Talk,” NPR’s “Day to Day,” KNX-AM and KFWB-AM. “The defense didn't want to run the risk of one of those compromise verdicts, and didn't feel the prosecution had proved murder beyond a reasonable doubt," Rosenbluth told the Los Angeles Times, which noted that Rosenbluth has regularly attended or watched the five-month-long trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court. In a widely carried Associated Press article, Prof. Jody Armour addressed the possibility that the judge might offer the jury the option of convicting Spector on a lesser charge, in order to break the deadlock. This could make any conviction vulnerable upon appeal, legal scholars said. “He’s certainly taking a gamble that the defense won’t be able to make a plausible argument on appeal,” Armour said, who was also interviewed on KABC. “Right now it’s an all-or-nothing proposition, and clearly some people don’t like second-degree [murder], and some do,” Prof. Michael Brennan said in a second Associated Press story.</p>

                <p>A story featured Prof. Elyn Saks and her book ‘The Center Cannot Hold,’ a memoir about her experiences with schizophrenia. The book is “the beautifully written saga of a young woman grappling with mental illness and ultimately triumphing [and] a voice from a country rarely heard from, the land of psychosis,” the article stated. Saks said that there are many misconceptions about the disease which she hoped to dispel with her book, such as the view that schizophrenics are wild. “In fact, of all the major mental illnesses, they’re the least violent,” Saks said. New medications have helped her condition, she said. “Now, I’m mostly well,” she said. “I do have episodes, but it’s not like I’m struggling all of the time to stay on the right side of the line.”</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was profiled in an article about his recruitment to USC Law School. Rasmussen assumed his position August 1 after an 18-month national search concluded in May, the story reported. At Vanderbilt University, Rasmussen was a widely cited bankruptcy law expert, an award-winning professor and an enthusiastic recruiter and mentor of young faculty. “It’s very important for the law school to have someone who has been an excellent, active scholar,” said Prof. Scott Altman who was on the search committee. Among Rasmussen’s top priorities at USC is adding 10 new faculty members and tightening the school’s admission process. Rasmussen will also tap USC’s vast resources, such as its location and its network of high-powered alumni, the article stated. “One thing I’ve learned since being designated dean is we have some of the most talented, successful alumni in the world,” Rasmussen said. “They’ve chosen to give back to the community through the law school.” The dean is the main fundraiser, said Prof. Elizabeth Garrett, who is also USC vice provost for academic affairs and was co-chair of the search committee. The Gould School was recently ranked No. 16 among law schools by U.S. News & World Report, up from No. 18 in 2004, the story stated. Last year, it received 6,000 applications for 200 spots for the class of 2008. Rasmussen¹s wife, renowned constitutional law scholar Rebecca Brown, will join the USC faculty in summer 2008, according to the story.</p>

                <p>Prof. John Matsusaka of USC’s Initiative and Referendum Institute was quoted in a story about direct democracy in America. The Democracy Foundation has proposed a national initiative and referendum system, the story stated. One problem with such a system is protecting individual rights from the tyranny of the majority, such as when Oklahoma voters suspended voting rights for African Americans nearly a century ago, Matsusaka said. However, you can also find similar examples that came out of legislatures, he noted. Concerns that voters would only approve spending increases and tax cuts are not supported by the research, Matsusaka added. “If you look at the data, initiative states have no higher debt levels on average, their bond ratings are no worse on average, they have no higher taxes or deficits,” he said.</p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich wrote a column about how families cope with fears of terrorism. Estrich writes, “It’s hard to stop thinking of the terrorists in our midst when they pack cars with nails and drive into airports wearing explosive vests…Be vigilant, we are told, and its good advice. A vigilant public is our best protection against foreign objects, smoking cars, crazies in our midst. But there is a fine line between vigilance and fear, between living with terror and living in terror.”</p>

Bush is not addressing the real terror threat by waging a losing war in Iraq. “The threat to us from Osama [bin Laden] and his gang, to the surprise of almost no one, is coming primarily from Pakistan, which we’ve been largely ignoring, while we spend billions every day fighting a losing war in Iraq…The war in Iraq has not only diverted our resources and attention from the threat we face from Al Qaeda, but actually exacerbated it.”</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was highlighted in a story on law school dean recruitment. Several top law schools in Southern California, including the Gould School, recently named deans who came from outside their own faculty ranks, a strategic departure from those chosen in past years, the article reported. An outside dean "always brings a new perspective and can look at things afresh," Rasmussen said, adding that he is the first dean to arrive from outside the Gould School since 1930. Traditionally, most top law schools have hired deans from within their own faculty, but that practice has changed, he noted. "As we see more movement among all faculty members, it's natural to assume we'll see more outside people becoming dean," he explained. One of Rasmussen's top priorities is to aggressively hire more faculty members, according to the story.</p>

                <p>USC Law School's Post-Conviction Justice Project was highlighted in an article. For the past 14 years, Profs. Carrie Hempel and Michael Brennan have trained students to work with the USC Law clinic and four other nonprofit organizations under the umbrella organization Habeas Project. Many of these students have taken on cases involving imprisoned women who could have benefited at their original trials from expert testimony on battering and its effects. The project has helped release 15 clients in the past 10 years, Hempel said. For years, courts in California did not allow expert testimony on abuse or inclusion of an abusive history in testimony, resulting in first-degree murder convictions and lengthy sentences for some abused women, she explained. A San Francisco Chronicle story also noted that the USC project is a partner of the Habeas Project.</p>

                <p>In her "Blue Streak" column, Prof. Susan Estrich addressed leadership changes in Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign. While two departed campaign managers have been blamed for McCain's faltering bid, such people generally get too much credit for success and too much blame for failure, Estrich wrote. "The difference between successful candidates and not-so-successful ones, in the last analysis, tends to be the candidate, and the decisions he makes, not who he hires," she continued. "The problem with the McCain campaign isn't the guys running it, but the candidate himself," she wrote.</p>

Hillary Clinton¹s chances of winning the presidency.  “The real Hillary Clinton is much loved by her friends, much respected by her fiercely loyal staff, a woman who is far warmer, funnier, and more human than the caricature that still dominates her public image,” Estrich wrote. “And it will be the real Hillary Clinton who voters see by the time November 2008 rolls around, as it was in New York in the last two elections. By then, the question may well be not whether she can win, but as it was in New York, whether anyone can beat her.”</p>

The man was acquitted on charges related to his shooting of an Air Force enlisted man, but the airman's family has asked the U.S. attorney's office to pursue federal charges. "It is rare for federal authorities to bring the same or similar criminal charges after an acquittal in state court," Lonergan said. "You do have well-established policies in place that there is presumption against filing the same charges federally."</p>

"In 1911 the I&R movement's journal 'Equity' explained New Jersey's failure in terms of its being 'The Trust State:' the nation's biggest businesses were chartered there, and they were the major source of opposition to I&R," the institute reported.</p>

People know your name here, faculty and administration are accessible, and your success is everyone's priority - all of which makes for an unparalleled student experience.</p>

                <p>Vice Dean Scott Altman was quoted about the parental rights of Debbie Rowe, mother of Michael Jackson’s older children. “If Ms. Rowe steps forward and says she wants custody, there’s a reasonable chance she will be granted custody,” Altman said. This Associated Press story was carried widely.</p>

                <p>Prof. Edward McCaffery was interviewed on “The Situation Room” about the possibility that Michael Jackson’s children are not biologically his. This would matter if there is no valid will, McCaffery said. “If there is a valid will, the Is were dotted, the Ts were crossed, no fraud, no suspicious circumstances, Michael Jackson could leave his estate to his neighbor,” McCaffery pointed out. “But if there is not a valid will, or if there’s conflicts, there could be a question,” he added.</p>

                <p>Prof. Kim Buchanan was interviewed on “Newshour” about the California Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Proposition 8. It is likely that same-sex marriage will be placed on the ballot in 2010 or 2012, Buchanan told NBC News Los Angeles affiliate KNBC-TV. “The trend lines of all of the polls indicate increasing acceptance for same-sex marriage,” she said. “Given that the margin favoring exclusive heterosexual marriage keeps diminishing, eventually I think what we’re likely to see in California — as we have seen in some of the Northeastern states — is a democratic majority favoring same-sex marriage.” Buchanan also was interviewed on KPCC-FM’s “AirTalk” and KFI-AM.</p>

Bringing Cheney back brings the country back to the period we overwhelmingly voted to leave behind.”</p>

Arnold Schwarzenegger' did not block a parole recommendation of Connie Keel, the prison inmate represented by USC Law student Adam Reich through the Post-Conviction Justice Project. The woman's husband had pointed a loaded gun at her and told her to stay in the car while he and his cousin made a spur-of-the moment decision to rob the store, Reich said in an Associated Press story. "Connie has spent three decades behind bars, a whole generation's lifetime, because her abusive husband murdered a store clerk," Reich said. "She has led a tragic life, and paid her dues." The story was also covered by the San Francisco Chronicle, The Mercury News, KCBS and KNBC.</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was quoted about concerns among local horsemen that Santa Anita Park’s paymaster accounts will be frozen when owner Magna Entertainment Corp. files for bankruptcy this week. It’s unlikely that the government will freeze the paymaster’s account, Rasmussen said. “The court would have the power to freeze it but my guess is that the parties will agree to let the people pull from the fund,” he added. “It’s hard to run a racetrack without horses.”

Arnold Schwarzenegger. “This woman served 29 years in prison for sitting in a car,” Reich said. Keel had been raped, beaten and threatened by her husband, and she suffered from battered women’s syndrome, Reich said. Reich represented Keel at her sixth hearing before the California Board of Parole in October; the board recommended that Keel be released. Now her fate is in the hands of the governor, who will make a decision within 30 days, the story reported.</p>

The collection was gifted to USC in 1998 by the International Academy of Trial Lawyers Foundation at the suggestion of USC alumnus James Ackerman, the story noted. “It’s been wonderful to have it here,” said Leonette Williams, associate director of the Law Library for Collections and Technical Services. “[Lincoln’s] 200th birthday is such a great time to be highlighting the collection,” she added.</p>

                <p>Prof. Alexander Capron was interviewed about the ethics of fertility treatments. “In the case of fertility drugs, the standard is that the doctor will monitor the number of eggs that are developing and will counsel the woman not to have intercourse, or will not use artificial insemination,” Capron explained. Those caveats are designed to avoid what doctors call mega-multiple births, such as the recent octuplets. In a society that recognizes reproductive choice as a human right, most doctors shy away from questions such as who is and isn’t entitled to bear children, the article stated. “I think the general view in the profession is there is a line that isn’t the doctors’ business,” Capron explained.</p>

                <p>A column by Susan Estrich was published about heiress Paris Hilton being paid $100,000 to attend an Australian New Year's Eve party. "Presumably, she got that much money ... either because the promoter is an egomaniacal nutcase or because he could make that much more from those willing to pay a high price to be in Hilton's presence," Estrich wrote. "My fear is that it's the latter, which is truly pitiful."</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was interviewed in a report about USC Law adjusting its grading scale to raise the average grade point average of the first-year class, and all future incoming students, from 3.2 to 3.3. Rasmussen proposed the change when he discovered that USC's curve was lower than the ones used by comparable schools, according to the story. "I think the faculty carefully considered it and decided this was the way to go," Rasmussen said. The change will give USC's students GPAs that are more closely aligned with those of their academic competitors and eliminate any disadvantage in the law firm recruiting process, the story stated.</p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was interviewed about Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by the Tribune, which owns the Los Angeles Times, KTLA, Chicago Tribune and other companies. “Inside a bankruptcy, you’re going to have to renegotiate the debt and there are simply going to be a lot of people looking very hard at the operations of the Tribune, the Los Angels Times and f its constituent parts. They’re going to look at where they can achieve cost savings. He added that despite a bankruptcy filing, quality companies usually stay in business.</p>

In a range of legal issues from obscenity standards to national security privacy, prosecutors must take into account public perception and societal standards, Lonergan said. A recent case involving the beating death of a puppy has had the public up in arms, the story reported. "The D.A. may say they are not going to be influenced, but some question if they really are influenced by outrage and media coverage," Lonergan noted. </p>

                <p>Dean Robert Rasmussen was interviewed about a proposal modifying USC Law’s grading curve. He said the law school analyzed data to determine that USC's grading curve was unusually low. USC Law students have LSAT scores comparable to those of students at Vanderbilt University Law School and UCLA Law School. However, the average GPAs of students at Vanderbilt and UCLA are higher than at USC, Rasmussen said. "It's seems pretty clear that they are giving out higher grades than we are," he said. "This is just a small change to bring us in line with our peers."</p>

                <p>Profs. Kim Buchanan, David B. Cruz and Daria Roithmayr were interviewed about same-sex marriage in California. Buchanan said that liberal and conservative young people see the issue differently than older generations. "I think, given my experiences as a professor at USC, young people, including conservatives, don't really see what the harm is in same-sex marriage," Buchanan said. Cruz said the passage of Proposition 8 would slow gay marriage, but wouldn't stop it. Roithmayr said that recent events have tipped the scale toward gay marriage. "First, the gay-rights movement has been quite active, much more politically so than prior to 2000," Roithmayr said. "Second, I think it is a willingness to see this as a civil rights issue as opposed to a special rights issue. Thinking about it that way pushes people toward inclusiveness." </p>

Clinton's appointment will have positive effects, Estrich added. "There's a half-dozen people in the world with her stature," she explained. "Both Obama and Clinton believe that diplomacy has to be used with much more dexterity, and there's not a room where Hillary can walk into where she isn't going to carry a unique command internationally." </p>

Based on the exit polls, Hillary not only would have won, but she would have won by more than Obama did.” </p>

Proposition 8 allows a bare majority to take away a fundamental right from a minority group entitled to the greatest judicial protection, Cruz said. “It would cut the courts out of the loop and not leave them to play their role, their traditional role of protecting the minority,” he explained. He was also quoted about Prop. 8 in La Opinion , Hoy, Kyodo News and a Brazilian newspaper about Prop. 8. Cruz was also interviewed by Australian Radio, Fox Radio News, Voice of America and KIRO’s  “The Dave Ross Show”  in Seattle about Prop. 8.

Amendments are more minor changes; revisions are larger in effect. … Proposition 8 opponents are arguing that this change actually constitutes a revision, not an amendment, and therefore needed to go through the legislature.” </p>

Opponents have filed lawsuits objecting to the procedure by which the ban was brought to voters, arguing that it was not a constitutional amendment but a revision, which would require legislative approval prior to facing the popular vote. “It is actually a strong argument on the merits on how to best understand the revisions and amendments,” Cruz said. It was important for supporters of Proposition 8 to have it labeled as an amendment, because California’s legislature has twice passed laws to legalize same-sex marriage, he added. </p>

California Proposition 7, requiring alternative energy, is part of a general trend to force utilities to use more renewable and clean fuels, Matsusaka said. However, Proposition 7 is being opposed by all major environmental groups, the story reported. “The reason is that it’s written in such a way to define a clean energy provider to be a firm that uses a certain kind of fuel to produce its energy, but also generates more than 30 megawatts of power,” Matsusaka explained. “So it turns out that a vast number of solar producers and wind producers wouldn’t qualify because they’re too small, and it would essentially destroy that industry in the state.” </p>

They don't want to participate in Election Day politics because they know that's not their role.” Cruz said the Supreme Court may take up the question of whether the federal Voting Rights Act is constitutional. “Because we still see a lot of voting rights litigation today, even though we see much more ability of minority communities to elect their preferred representatives. We see significantly more diverse legislatures at both the state and national legislation because of the Voting Rights Act. If you abolished it this year, that would be a big deal,” Cruz said.</p>

He found some intriguing differences between states that allow citizen-initiated referendums and those that don’t, the article stated. For example, states with the initiative mechanism had significantly lower taxes and spending. From 1960 to 1990, per capita spending was about $83 lower in an initiative state than in a non-initiative state ‹ representing a $332 savings for the average family of four. Matsusaka also found that 70 percent to 80 percent of voters are glad to have initiatives and referendums in their state. </p>

                <p>In her “Blue Streak” column, Prof. Susan Estrich wrote about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s first joint fundraisers. “It is a whole lot easier to convince Clinton supporters to give to Obama than it is to convince Obama supporters to give to Hillary,” Estrich wrote. “But in the long run, Obama needs to help Hillary at least as much as she needs to help him.”</p>

                <p>In her “Blue Streak” column, Prof. Susan Estrich wrote about ways in which Barack Obama is “pushing the envelope” in his campaign strategy. For example, Obama is planning to give his nomination acceptance speech in a football stadium to a crowd of some 70,000 people, the column noted. “And while it certainly occurred to me to move Dukakis’ convention speech outside the hall in 1988, and I even suggested it to the Gore people in 2000, there are all kinds of reasons to think that Barack Obama may in fact be the first Democratic candidate since John Kennedy in 1960 who can pull off a speech to a football-size crowd,” Estrich wrote.</p>

                <p>Prof. Susan Estrich was interviewed about Barack Obama’s gradual shift to the center on Iraq. The story questioned whether the apparent shift would trigger backlash from the anti-war left. “Here’s the reality of the situation,” Estrich said. “If you’re against the war there are two candidates in this race: One talking about getting the troops home, whether it’s in three months or 18 months or whatever it is; and the other talking about a hundred-year war. I think the good news for Obama is that if he is indeed moving to the center, his base in the anti-war left is certainly secure.” Estrich was the campaign manager for Michael Dukakis’ 1988 presidential campaign. “She has suffered the wounds and knows the joys of high-stakes party politics that can only be experienced when you operate at its epicenter,” the story stated.</p>

                <p>In her “Blue Streak” column, Prof. Susan Estrich wrote about changing attitudes towards coal. “When I first started in politics, coal enjoyed bipartisan protection from political criticism,” Estrich wrote. “Democrats were unwilling to criticize coal because they wanted and needed the votes of the people who worked in the mines; Republicans were mum because they enjoyed the support of the people who owned and ran them,” she added. “But the protection coal enjoyed politically did not protect the public against its harmful impact. It did not protect miners from dying of black lung, or pregnant women from registering high levels of mercury. Speak no evil doesn't make the evil go away.”</p>

                <p>Prof. Michael Shapiro was quoted about a videotape showing staff at King-Harbor hospital ignoring a dying patient. “Many times, people... think, ‘If I keel over, I’m in a hospital, people will take care of me,’” Shapiro said. But that’s not necessarily true, he noted. Such incidents happen more often than people think, he added. “I think it reflects deficiencies in the human character,” he added. Shapiro is a bioethics expert, the story noted.</p>

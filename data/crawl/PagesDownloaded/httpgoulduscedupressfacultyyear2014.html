People know your name here, faculty and administration are accessible, and your success is everyone's priority - all of which makes for an unparalleled student experience.</p>

                <p>Sam Erman was quoted about the politics of appointing Supreme Court justices and how the next president could change the makeup of the court. "They have the job for life, so they don't have to worry about politics in the way that other powerful members of the government have to," Erman said. "So even though their decisions seem political to us, I think that the justices are committed to the notion of legality." "Even if everyone is appointed at the same age, their tenures on the court will be longer. So these influential moments for presidents [to nominate justices] may become farther and farther between," he added.</p>

                <p>Lisa Klerman was quoted about a racial and disability discrimination case filed against the city of Los Angeles by a former park groundskeeper. Klerman said the case is "rare" not only because the plaintiff is white, but because there is direct evidence of racial discrimination.

                <p>Tom Lyon was featured for his research which influenced a recent Supreme Court decision that will allow children’s statements to teachers about potential abuse to be submitted as evidence. In his written opinion, Justice Samuel Alito cited work done by Lyon and USC students over the last decade. "It was a terrific feeling to see work that I’ve been doing for years to not only influence the court but to influence in a way that I think will really help children," Lyon said.</p>

"I think that it's going to be the highest salience, that the many candidates in the Republican field and the handful of Democratic candidates are going to be engaging with this. The further right a Republican candidate is going to be, the bigger a bulls-eye they're going to paint on the Supreme Court, due to decisions like the Obamacare decision and the decision for marriage for same-sex couples," Cruz said.</p>

                <p>Emily Ryo's article "Less Enforcement, More Compliance: Rethinking Unauthorized Migration" was highlighted by leading criminal and immigration law scholar Juliet Stumpf as one of the best recent works of scholarship related to immigration. "Ryo concludes that these noncitizens' belief that the U.S. immigration law system is immoral lends support to their view that violations of the system may be 'the only viable moral choice under the circumstances.' Her prescriptions -- that the U.S. craft a development strategy that promotes job opportunities, and set up an expanded temporary worker program that would permit circular migration of workers -- lines up, perhaps for the first time, with empirical data about why those programs might increase compliance with immigration law," Stumpf wrote.</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was quoted in a story about the controversy surrounding Rachel Dolezal, the president of the Spokane NAACP chapter who resigned following revelations that she is a biologically white woman posing as black. Armour pointed out the irony in the public's negative response to Dolezal after celebrating Bruce Jenner's transition to becoming Caitlyn, but said that argument can only be taken so far. "I can’t get up in the morning and tell a police officer, 'I'm transracial today. Treat me as a white man,'" Armour said. "Michael Brown couldn’t be transracial.... When you walk into prisons and jail cells, you see cellblocks brimming with bodies that are conspicuously black. Those black bodies had no choice in how they were perceived."</p>

                <p>Camille Gear Rich was quoted in a story about the controversy surrounding Rachel Dolezal, the president of the Spokane NAACP chapter who resigned following revelations that she is a biologically white woman posing as black. Rich argued that while Dolezal's decision was "regrettable" but "sympathetic," the public uproar over her actions is discriminatory and devalues black women. "Being a black woman is such a stigmatized identity that someone who would opt out of whiteness into blackness is 'showing a sign of mental illness,'" Rich said. "There are lots of reasons why her decision to become aesthetically black is not a sign of mental illness."</p>

"She was trying to live a life that was authentic to her. Should she have lied? Absolutely not. I think a lot of people operate in society by misrecognition....

                <p>Camille Gear Rich was quoted about how the controversy surrounding Rachel Dolezal may reflect the changing fluidity of the definition of race and racial structures. "It forces us to really question whether or not this biological basis for identity is a smart path to continue down in the future," she said. Rich added she is wary of those who announce themselves as a member of a community. "There might be some spaces in which Rachel gets to be a black person, but I want to be very careful about any context in which she is taking away resources from people who have come from a more subordinated experience," she said. The original AP story quoting Rich was also picked up by The New York Times and U.S. News & World Report.</p>

"Dolezal lied. She should not have lied, but she lied for reasons with which we can sympathize," Rich wrote. "I admire the way she chose to live her life as a black person. Advocating for anti-racism efforts is ethical and admirable if she wanted to claim blackness as a social identity. Those quick to throw stones well know that there are costs to living life as a black person, and once Dolezal made the switch she seems never to have looked back."</p>

                <p>Chinese scientists recently used a method for “editing” genes to attempt to make inheritable DNA changes in human embryos. The American molecular biologists that developed the technique, called Crispr-Cas9, are alarmed but doubt that their invention can be controlled. In an essay in the "Room for Debate" column in the online NY Times, Alex Capron examined whether a useful precedent can be found in the extraordinary moratorium that researchers imposed on their own use of the then-new technique of recombinant DNA in the mid-1970s, which culminated in a meeting at Asilomar, outside Monterey, California, where standards for future research were adopted.  He concludes that a process established solely by scientists would not be adequate for the profound ethical and social issues involved in attempts to directly “improve” our descendants.  The challenge is how to get experts to clarify the issues sufficiently to stimulate a process of democratic deliberation about them “in town halls, churches, schools and living rooms across the nation” so that the public can have a voice in resolving them.</p>

He said that one of the themes of the book is figuring out the right size of government. "The book argues strenuously that, in fact, government investment and insurance have big payoffs. Not just touchy-feely payoffs, but big economic payoffs. We're starving ourselves as a country by not making the kinds of investments only government can make, by not offering the kind of insurance that government is ideally situated to make. And so when we argue about taxes, we're putting the cart before the horse," he said.</p>

                <p>Nomi Stolzenberg wrote an essay about Orthodox Jewish notions of purity and the conflicts between religious purists and pragmatists living in the modern world. "Many of the practices of so-called religious traditionalists are historical novelties. But so too is the growing belief that a liberal society has an obligation to accommodate such practices," she wrote.</p>

                <p>Dan Simon published the op-ed "Sobering Lessons From the Lone Juror in the Etan Patz Case." Simon said that in the absence of any physical evidence connecting Pedro Hernandez to the murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, the case revolved entirely on the jury's assessment of unrecorded statements. "It seems likely that we will never know for sure whether Hernandez's confession was true," Simon wrote. "But based on the evidence presented in court, there is good reason to believe that the lone juror got it right." Simon stated that the Hernandez case “demonstrates the grip that misguided intuitions hold on public perception and it begs for their revision: on occasion, innocent people do indeed confess to crimes they did not commit, and they go on to provide richly detailed statements that corroborate their false admissions of guilt."</p>

Cruz said he could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the upcoming case.

Indeed, it is typical practice especially in limited civil cases for a plaintiff to apply for entry of a defendant's default soon after the usual 30 days after service is complete and the defendant has failed to file an answer or otherwise respond," he wrote.</p>

"The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us," he wrote.</p>

He  gave this as an explanation for the second and final revision to the Tax Day date in 1955: "According to an IRS spokesman, the move 'spread out the peak workload,' but there's another explanation.

                <p>Edward Kleinbard was quoted about General Electric's decision to take a $6 billion tax hit by repatriating about $36 billion in foreign earnings back to the U.S. "This reflects both their existential despair over seeing tax reform any time soon, and the increasing implausibility of their claims that in fact their offshore earnings will in fact ever be put to work in new foreign investments,” he said.</p>

                <p>Michael Chasalow was quoted several times in an article discussing a lawsuit by shareholders of a technology start-up, alleging that venture capital investors had violated fiduciary duties to the company.   Chasalow … was skeptical about [the plaintiff shareholder’s] version of events. While it's not unusual for venture capital firms to be wary of new investors that could shrink their slice of the pie, it wouldn't make sense for a venture capitalist to block new investments to the point where it sinks the company, he said. "It doesn't ring true to me," he said.  …. "Merely because you and I are both investors — and we make the same decision — doesn't mean we are acting in concert and making decisions as one dominant shareholder."</p>

It's showing that you're telling the community you take this issue seriously, and the Pasadena Police Department can show the community they take it seriously through transparency and not through shrouding findings in secrecy," Armour said.</p>

"This is a downward trend that will continue for at least the next three years, maybe longer."

"The scientific psychological research is realizing that simply applying straight forward de-bias [techniques] is not an effective way to counter this problem.

                <p>Gillian Hadfield and her work were featured in two stories about legal services and licensing nonlawyers.  New York Judge Jonathan Lippman credited Hadfield for his interest in using non lawyers  After hearing her speak at a Harvard Law School forum, Lippman invited Hadfield to New York to testify before his Task Force to Expand Access to Civil Legal Services. Of licensing non lawyers, Hadfield said: “Suppose LegalZoom or Rocket Matter could hire LLLTs and have them answering phone calls, engaging in online chats- maybe even manning retail outlets - and giving assistance actually filling out the forms and navigating the procedures, all based on protocols developed by lawyers and by the company. That’s the way you significantly reduce the gap. Then the LLLT can be hired at lower cost.". </p>

Maybe consciously or unconsciously, they may not be as zealous in going after a co-worker or professional family member that they would going after someone else,” Armour said.</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was quoted about police violence inciting a "moral revolution" in American society. “The earlies urban riots, racial riots in the 1960s involved police encounters with a citizen; it didn’t go to trial, but the Black Citizen’s League got very upset and started marching, starting rioting. It was an early kind of harbinger to a [moral revolution],” Armour said.</p>

                <p>Jonathan Handel was quoted in a story about the fallout of the hack on Sony Pictures. The vast exposure of the inner workings of Sony has disoriented an industry built on confidentiality and relationships. “It opens the veil for Hollywood lawyers, filmmakers and actors who will now have information they can say they are entitled to,” said Handel. “This is really important access, because Hollywood studios are always claiming poverty and that they don’t make money on their movies, but then they go to Wall Street and say otherwise.”</p>

He can bask in kind of the public eye and the media attention and be the focal point in a way that you can’t perhaps at other times in the day.

                <p>The Initiative and Referendum Institute was cited regarding a declining number of citizen-led ballot initiatives. According to the Institute, the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down even though it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide. The number of citizen-led initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an even-numbered year since 1974, in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballot.</p>

                <p>Data from the Initiative and Referendum Institute was cited on this year's citizen-led ballot initiatives. Nearly one-quarter of the questions on this year’s ballot are citizen-led initiatives, a policymaking tool with a roughly 2 in 5 historical chance of passing, according to data compiled by the Institute.</p>

                <p>Gillian Hadfield was interviewed about the need for change in the legal field. Lawyers need to leverage new technology to increase accessibility to advising and services, she said. "Lawyers are the ones that should be living within the context of 'what is it that people really need?'" Hadfield said. What’s missing is a platform to help connect lawyers with people who need legal help. Hadfield says that currently, “the only way those platforms can emerge in a really robust way is if lawyers build them themselves, finance them themselves, and run them themselves. They can’t share their profits with anybody else, like a software developer who has a great idea.”</p>

                <p>An op-ed by Edward Kleinbard ran about how to create an American fiscal system that addresses growing income inequality. While many academics advocate for a raising top marginal income tax as a solution, that's only half of the equation, Kleinbard wrote. The other half is how tax monies are spent: "The better response to income disparity is not to tax the rich more, but to boost revenue over all so that government can invest more, and offer higher quality social insurance programs." Harvard Business Review commented on Kleinbard's op-ed. The Washington Post ran a review of Kleinbard's book, "We Are Better Than This," which is "packed with powerful data, fresh insights, unassailable analysis, and a set of recommendations that are both economically and politically viable."</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard's new book, "We Are Better Than This: How Government Should Spend Our Money," was reviewed by Jared Bernstein, former Obama administration economist and CNBC and MSNBC contributor. In his review, Bernstein writes: "This book will not only help you separate the sense from the nonsense in America's fiscal debate. Far more importantly, it will remind you why we need a functional federal government and the extremely high costs in terms of our economic well-being, today and tomorrow, of its absence... Kleinbard describes himself as a "Dutch uncle" which the dictionary tells me is someone who admonishes sternly and bluntly... tells us the hard truths whether we want to hear them or not. But he's actually considerably friendlier than that, and while the book is dense with subject matter that ranges from the national income accounting system to the precise definition of capital income in the tax code, he works hard to make it all reader friendly."

One of the biggest is the practice of keeping much of their income overseas and out of reach of the IRS. Altogether, American corporations paid an effective tax rate of 12.6 percent in 2010, the last year for which figures are available,” he said.</p>

                <p>David Cruz was interviewed about the Supreme Court deciding the issue of gay marriage. On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court made history by invalidating parts of the Defense of Marriage Act, which restricted marriage to heterosexual couples. But the nine justices left it to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. In Utah and Virginia, where lower courts have struck down the state bans, the Supreme Court has blocked couples from marrying as it weighs whether to legalize the unions nationwide. "If the Court were simply to deny review in all these cases, then the stays would be lifted and tens of millions of people would then be living in marriage equality states," he said.</p>

                <p> Edward Kleinbard was quoted about loopholes in the U.S. tax code that make corporate tax inversions irresistible for American companies to take advantage of. “It isn’t so much that the corporate tax code is too tough or the rate is too high; rather, he says, companies are taking advantage of loopholes in the code that make inversions almost irresistible for corporate executives,” he said.</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard’s paper on America's corporate tax burden, and how it's not as onerous on American companies as they claim, was covered. Kleinbard contends that U.S. companies have an advantage over their foreign competitors because of their ability to navigate around the high corporate tax rates. He also acknowledges that the current tax code is “highly distortive and inefficient.”</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was interviewed about segregation in America's schools. We see an intersection of race and class… years and years of race inequality created class inequality. When you get rid of intentional racism - when you get rid of Jim Crow - you still have the legacy of Jim Crow and slavery living on, in the class divisions. Now, what you have are a lot of parents from middle-class backgrounds saying ‘we don’t want our kids with kids who are less prepared if they’re coming from truly disadvantaged backgrounds; it’s nothing personal; it’s not about race; it’s about wanting my kid to go a good school… one that’s not at the bottom of school systems rankings,’” Armour explained.</p>

"Nobody likes to see how sausage is made.” Armour said that it's tough for smaller departments to resist the offer of free weaponry and pointed out, “How are you going to say no to high-powered ammunition, vehicles and the like, when the government is offering this gratis?”</p>

Kleinbard wrote about income inequality being a very real and tangible force in America. "The buoyant middle class that inequality deniers purport to have discovered is a creature of a decades-long fiscal policy of borrowing against the future by delivering more transfer benefits than our current level of tax collections can support," Kleinbard wrote.</p>

And it turns out that inversions are largely driven by efforts to redeploy the huge stashes of offshore cash that U.S. firms now hold and to engage in a kind of a self-help to reduce U.S. tax burdens by stripping income out of the United States,” Kleinbard said.</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard published an oped about the need to stop tax inversions, a process where a large U.S. company acquires a smaller one in a tax-friendly country like Ireland or the U.K. But the way the deal is structured, "the foreign minnow swallows the domestic whale," with the U.S. company ending up as a subsidiary of a foreign corporation. "If allowed to continue, inversions will eviscerate the U.S. domestic corporate tax base, because making a foreign company the parent of a U.S. firm opens up new tax-avoidance possibilities," Kleinbard wrote.</p>

Only with a nightmare you sit up in bed, open your eyes, and it goes away. No such luck with a psychotic episode.</p>

When asked what has changed due to the downing of the Malaysian air jet Lockman said, “I think what’s changed is international intention has now galvanized because of this tragic incident which has occurred, and this could lead, hopefully, to renewed pressure by the Obama administration and by allies in Europe on Vladimir Putin and his cronies.”</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was cited about the beating of a woman by a CHP officer. “I was shocked, but also not surprised. I would say these are among the worst times, in terms of police image and community relations since the Rodney King tape," said Armour. He notes the patrol officer's actions could hurt the public perception of all law enforcement agencies in the LA area, including the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was quoted about racial profiling that takes place while shopping. Attorney Portia Roberson paid the “black tax,” Armour said. “On one hand we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and we are celebrating how far we’ve come in race relations, what a landmark occasion that was for social justice. Yet on the other hand we were are talking about yet again a case of racial profiling that is still pervasive in America. The reason this is a story is because it happens so frequently.”</p>

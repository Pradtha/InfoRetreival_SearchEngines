<h2>Student Life</h2>
<p>From your first day on campus you'll notice USC Gould is different. It's small enough to be a community in the real sense of the word even though USC is one the country's largest research universities, and located in the second largest city in the United States. People know your name here, faculty and administration are accessible, and your success is everyone's priority - all of which makes for an unparalleled student experience.</p>

<h1>The Peer Mentor Program</h1>

<p>The Peer Mentor Program assists incoming first-year and transfer students with the transition to law school by providing continuous guidance and support throughout their entire first-year at USC. From the first day of Orientation to the last final exam in May, incoming students are assigned two Peer Mentors that serve as a primary resource throughout the first year. Mentors assist with this transition by making new students feel welcomed, connecting them with their new environment, and guiding them to social and developmental resources so that all entering students can become an integral part of the law school community. New students meet their specific Mentors during Orientation, and as the semester and year roll along, Mentors check-in regularly. Each selected Peer Mentor is an exceptional second-year law student who sincerely wants to help new students have a fun, successful and engaging first-year.</p>

<h1>2015-16 First-Year Peer Mentors</h1>

<h2><a href="mailto:cara.adams.2017@lawmail.usc.edu">Cara Adams</a></h2>
<h4>Undergraduate: New York University</h4>
<p>Growing up in Los Angeles, Cara Adams always wanted to be a pop star; upon realizing the world wasn't ready, however, she settled on the pursuit of higher education. She therefore graduated from New York University in 2014 where she majored in Media and Communications with a minor in Entertainment Business. It was this coursework, her extensive dance background, and internships with Disney, Def Jam, EMI Music, and Downtown Music Publishing that ultimately fostered her interest in Entertainment Law. She absolutely loved NYC, but Hurricane Sandy abruptly and rudely reminded her she is a California girl at heart. Thus, she chose to return home and become a Trojan, a decision she couldn't be happier with. This summer, Cara will be working as a supervising intern for the Intellectual Property and Technology Law Clinic. Next year, she will serve on the Black Law Students Association executive board. Outside of law school, Cara loves the beach, Kanye West, lobster rolls, Pilates, the NBA (Lakers, I love you even during the rough times) and kale. She is so excited to welcome the class of 2018 to the USC family! Fight on!</p>

<h2><a href="mailto:parsa.ansari.2017@lawmail.usc.edu">Parsa Ansari</a></h2>
<h4>Undergraduate: University of California, Irvine</h4>
<p>Parsa was born in Los Angeles, CA. He received his bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of California, Irvine. There, he spent a term studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain, spent another term interning on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C, and spent his time at UCI living in sunny Newport Beach. After taking a year off to spend time with family in Iran, Parsa enrolled at the USC Gould School of Law. During his first year of law school, Parsa served as a 1L rep for the Business Law Society. As a 2L, Parsa serves on USC's Student Bar Association as President of his 2L class for the 2015-16 academic year. In his free time, Parsa enjoys playing basketball, lifting weights, and watching USC football dominate the competition. He is very excited to welcome the class of 2018! Fight On!</p>

<h2><a href="mailto:zach.aries.2017@lawmail.usc.edu">Zach Aries</a></h2>
<h4>Undergraduate: George Washington University</h4>
<p>Zach was born and raised in Chicago, IL, and has been a city slicker ever since. He attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C., where he quickly immersed himself in the city's exciting political climate. He then decided that he wanted to attend law school, and that it should be located somewhere warm. Thus, he chose USC Gould, and got involved in the Business Law and Entertainment Law Societies. Zach is a huge sports fan and avid supporter of the Chicago Bulls, Blackhawks, Bears, and Cubs (unfortunately). Zach also enjoys fast cars, food, watches, and finance. He is extremely excited to give back to the school that has already given him so much and can't wait to meet and welcome the class of 2018. Fight on!</p>

<h4>Undergraduate: New York University </h4>
<p>Sareen Armani was born in Los Angeles and grew up in France.  She attended New York University and graduated in 2013 with a major in sociology.  As an undergraduate, Sareen spent her freshman year at NYU Paris, where she was the student council president.  Upon graduating a year early, she decided to apply to law school to pursue her dream of fighting for justice for all.  As a 1L, she was on the board of the Public Interest Law Foundation (PILF) and of the International Law and Relations Organization, and was a member of the Women's Law Association.  During her 1L summer, Sareen will be interning at the Department of Justice in downtown Los Angeles.  As a 2L, she is very excited to be a PILF board member as well as a Peer Mentor.  Outside of law school, she enjoys traveling, wandering and discovering, singing, and playing guitar and saxophone.  Sareen can't wait to meet and welcome the Class of 2018 to the Trojan family!  Fight on!</p>

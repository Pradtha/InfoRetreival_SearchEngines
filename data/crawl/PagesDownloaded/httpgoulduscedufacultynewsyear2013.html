<p>From your first day on campus you'll notice USC Gould is different. It's small enough to be a community in the real sense of the word even though USC is one the country's largest research universities, and located in the second largest city in the United States. People know your name here, faculty and administration are accessible, and your success is everyone's priority - all of which makes for an unparalleled student experience.</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was quoted about an American viral video of a woman being beaten, and how many European countries deem witnesses responsible if they don't try to rescue someone. Right now, citizens face no criminal liability for uploading videos of assault. However, there may be civil recourse when it comes to privacy issues. "There's a point at which you're getting into nitty-gritty private details that are so embarrassing or are potentially embarrassing that broadcasting them does great harm," Armour said.</p>

Trying to sell the team on her terms could be an attempt to separate herself from Sterling. “It’s a play for sympathy,” said Armour. “Donald Sterling, himself, is a very unsympathetic character to many people, not just on the basis of his words that were recorded and broadcast, but also on the basis of his history that nobody did anything about for a very long time...His wife, on the other hand, could say, ‘I’m an innocent party here. He has been philandering on me and I am the victim.’ She’s arguing the NBA can’t use the sins of her husband against the wife.”</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was quoted about the NBA forcing Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to sell his team. “Everyone seems to have leaped to the conclusion that it is acceptable to strip ownership from someone on the basis of private utterances to a confidante, possibly criminally recorded without his consent, certainly broadcast against his will,” said Armour. "That argument would empower owners to deprive another of his team if he wrote something in his diary that someone stole and broadcast. The illustrations could be multiplied, but it's a slippery slope we should hesitate to start sliding down. Our righteous indignation must be tempered by principle, by care and concern for competing interests such as personal privacy and free speech.”</p>

                <p>Susan Estrich wrote a column about a Holocaust-related paper assigned to students in Rialto, Calif. “Not everything is debatable. Not everything is relative or contextual. Some things are just lies. Some positions are evil. The Holocaust did happen. It was not 'merely a political scheme created to influence public emotion and gain wealth.' 9/11 did happen. Not everything is subject to a “conspiracy theory.” There are truths. Critical thinkers should know that.”</p>

I heard one today about a single mother, in prison for 14 years because she was a minor player in a drug conspiracy. Fourteen years? Sad and foolish. Prison beds are a precious, expensive, commodity. They should be reserved for those who present a danger to the rest of us and for those whose acts have harmed others.

                <p>Jody Armour was interviewed in a story marking the 22nd anniversary of the Los Angeles riots. He pointed out that since the riots, Americans have elected a black president to two terms, watched a black man coach an NFL team to a Super Bowl victory and seen a black woman win the Nobel Prize in literature. But Armour also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court rolled back the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action at colleges. Meanwhile, the nation has seen and heard racist comments from public figures as the patriarch on “Duck Dynasty,” and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy.</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was quoted about the ramifications of possible moves by the NBA. One choice for Adam Silver is to fine Clippers’ owner, Donald Sterling, hundreds of thousands of dollars for his remarks. That kind of punishment would amount to a financial slap on the wrist, said Armour, especially considering Sterling’s estimated $1.9 billion net worth. “But they can still turn it into a teachable moment or a PR coup by taking the fine and donating it to an anti-racism cause, ” he also said.  Armour said that “the owners would be reluctant to give Adam Silver the power to suspend an owner for something he said in private. There’s a slippery slope problem from an owner's perspective.”</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was interviewed about Donald Sterling's racist remarks. He said that the NBA doesn’t have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Sterling is guilty of making the comments in order to levy fines or suspend him. “This isn’t a criminal trial. They just have to determine that it’s more likely than not that [Sterling] made these damaging statements. Once they reach that conclusion, and they’ve done a thorough investigation, then they should be pretty insulated against a suit by Sterling against the NBA,” said  Armour. “But they have to dot their i’s and cross their t’s, because Sterling himself is a lawyer. So he knows his legal rights, and he will, I’m sure, enforce them to the fullest,” Armour said.</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was interviewed about Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling's racist comments and potential legal action. One thing that may work in Sterling’s favor, at least legally, is that the recording was of a private conversation – not attitudes that he was spouting publicly, legal analysts say. “This may not be the kind of behavior that the NBA feels comfortable going after,” says Armour. “They know people express their private demons in situations where they don’t expect to get out. That makes this more difficult."</p>

                <p>Michael Chasalow was interviewed about the controversy surrounding racist remarks made my Clippers owner, Donald Sterling. The league has the power to levy fines or suspend owners, a very uncommon occurrence, according to Chasalow. If and when it does, it is entirely possible that Sterling would sue. Chasalow also said the NBA's constitution is not public, but that it reportedly does permit league leaders to sell a team without an owner's consent. Therefore, among Silver's choices are to instigate fines and selling Sterling's team. "You need someone to have been wronged. The question is, who has been wronged?" Chasalow said.</p>

We were often very cynical about Congress and deservedly so, but it's also the case that Congress has a very refined notion of justice. Every time you draw a line, somebody falls on the wrong side of the line and Congress then tries to then re-tailor the line to deal with that sympathetic case, so we end up with one sympathetic case piled on another. Then, from the other direction, every time we hear a single abusive case, Congress becomes indignant and we have to carve out the abuse case – and the result is extraordinary complexity,” Kleinbard said.</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was interviewed about the Supreme Court's ruling on McCutcheon v. FEC and how it could affect democracy in America. "Sometimes the court has been on the side of expanding the franchise," Armour said, "Other times, as today arguably after Buckley v Valeo, Citizens United, and McCutcheon, arguably the court is in the process of limiting some of the democratic power of ordinary people and protecting those of corporations and property interests,” Armour said.</p>

                <p>Susan Estrich contributed a column about how politics interferes with medical treatment for women. “If a woman has a right to choose, which is what Roe v. Wade says, then how that medical decision is executed — that is, in a hospital or in a clinic, using a surgical or a nonsurgical method, by one doctor or two doctors or a highly qualified nurse or a physician's assistant — is and should be a medical decision, not a political one... If you had told me back when I worked on my first abortion case nearly 40 years ago that we would still be at it, still be fighting and litigating over new efforts to restrict abortion, I would not have believed it. It is not just a waste of lawyer time and court time. It is nothing short of cruel.”</p>

                <p>Heidi Rummel was quoted about the Mary Jones case as the Post-Conviction Justice Project's directing attorney. She said that although the case was long and difficult, it was the right outcome for an "extraordinary woman.” Rummel expressed, “I'm more excited than I've been in a long time. We worked so hard on it, and Mary's such an extraordinary woman. We got a reasonable D.A. who was willing to do the right thing."</p>

"To excel in American society," Armour interprets, "you need to feel your team, your group is better than the other teams and groups around - that you're superior... I'm not sure that that is the ethos that we want Americans who are trying to get along and meld... How does that play out in the hiring context? Do you look at members of your group first to hire when jobs come up? ... I, you, anyone can get up in the morning and say 'I'm it.' That doesn't mean that you're better than anyone else. A lot of people can be it. In fact, God can reside in all of us."</p>

This provides some perspective on the newest federalist, Barack Obama, who has taken the unusual steps of publicly giving up on Congress and trying to take his messages to the states...instead of leading the Democratic Party in a campaign against a “do-nothing” Congress, Obama is raising money for Democrats and running away from Congress.</p>

                <p>Alexander Capron was cited about a complicated medical case involving a brain-dead girl. While the families of the brain-dead usually take doctors at their word, or at least accept that their loved one’s life is over, something went wrong; both the hospital and the family lawyered up. The hospital portrayed the family as ignorant. “There is absolutely no medical possibility that Ms. McMath’s condition is reversible or that she will someday recover from death,” Shanahan told the California Superior Court. Meanwhile, experts consulted by the McMaths’ legal team—who included a “forensic-intelligence analyst,” an Ohio doctor who concluded that the teen-ager was reacting to the presence of her family and thus could not be dead.</p>

"There is a sense that this is a potential tipping-point election," Matsusaka said. "If voters here [in California] accept the concept of same-sex marriage, that will have an effect on the way people think across the country," he added. By November 4, the measure's opponents and supporters expect to spend about $40 million -- a large amount for a social issue initiative, according to Matsusaka.

He noted that the federal government has been subsidizing employee healthcare coverage for decades, with the cost going as high as $250 billion per year. “Cash salary and bonuses are taxable income,” Kleinbard wrote, “while the value of healthcare costs paid by your employer go ignored. If you claim to stand on principle in your demands to destroy the Affordable Care Act, first give back the $250 billion you've been taking every year in government help." </p>

                <p>John Matsusaka of the USC Initiative and Referendum Institute was quoted in a story about the impact of ballot proposals in the presidential race. In California, Arizona and Florida, initiatives seek to amend the state constitutions and define marriage as solely between a man and a woman. "California's measure is distinctly important because the movement to legalize gay marriage thus far has been driven by the courts," Matsusaka said. "If California voters reject the amendment banning gay marriage, it will be the first significant popular affirmation of gay marriage."</p>

Ryo said the study suggests that increased enforcement is not the most effective way to discourage illegal immigration. But she conceded that it’s possible the border could become so secure under the proposed reform that it would start to have a bigger effect on potential migrants’ decision-making processes. “There’s likely a threshold point to which increased enforcement ... will have some deterrent effect,” Ryo told Yahoo News. “It’s hard to imagine that it wouldn’t if you think about the kinds of measures being proposed." But Ryo said she hopes her study will cause policymakers to think about other ways to deter illegal immigration that are not related to border security and enforcement. “We should be asking whether this level of spending on this single issue is justified in terms of opportunity costs,” she said.</p>

"This study offers insights into how unauthorized migrants justify their violation of US immigration law, and how such justifications might make noncompliance with this particular law possible among otherwise law-abiding individuals. People generally see themselves as moral beings who want to do the right thing as they perceive it. If you ask an average person, why are there so many unauthorized migrants in the US, the typical story that you might get is something like this: people are looking for better jobs, better economic opportunities for themselves and their families and our immigration enforcement just isn't tough enough to stop them; so, here they are," Ryo said.

He went to Syria and met with the rebel forces. McCain favors stronger military action. He is looking for (and maybe believes he has, if he were to speak freely) a supporter and an ally in Dempsey, a voice at the table advocating for and not merely explaining the military option,” she wrote.</p>

The story noted Armour is the author of "Negrophobia and Reasonable Racism: The Hidden Costs of Being Black in America." "Your heart could go out to George Zimmerman or Trayvon Martin," Armour said, "I think rather than looking to either as a scapegoat, we need to look at what took us as a society to this point." </p>

                <p>Los Angeles affiliate KCBS-TV highlighted the USC Gould School Post-Conviction Project, which has represented Glenda Virgil for more than 14 years. She was convicted of killing her abusive husband after he attacked her with a shovel. USC Gould School student Julia Deixler handled Virgil's parole hearing. “To me, it is obvious that Glenda Virgil does not pose a danger to anyone,” Deixler said.</p>

                <p> Mark Litwak wrote an article about the legal issues that may arise from creating fictional characters in film, “If a fictional character is loosely based on a real-life individual, and the public cannot identify the real-life individual from the context in which the fictional character is portrayed, there is little risk of liability,” Litwak said.</p>

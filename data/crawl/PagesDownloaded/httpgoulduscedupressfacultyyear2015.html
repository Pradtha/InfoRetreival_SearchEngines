People know your name here, faculty and administration are accessible, and your success is everyone's priority - all of which makes for an unparalleled student experience.</p>

                <p>Susan Estrich wrote a column about the significance of superdelegates for choosing a Democratic presidential nominee that the party establishment believes to be electable in the general election. "And by the time Bill Clinton came around — who happened to be part of what I fondly termed the 'little white boys caucus,' which supported superdelegates — Democrats had lost enough to understand that the purpose of the nomination process was to pick a candidate who might win, rather than define the heart and soul of the party," Estrich wrote. "That is why we have superdelegates, and why they most assuredly do count."</p>

                <p>Alexander Capron was asked about the ethical implications of life-extending therapies. Life expectancy is already intertwined with geography, wealth and education, and Capron said that life-extending medical treatments could widen the existing gap.

                <p>Gregory Keating was quoted about pending litigation against Volkswagen over the company's diesel emissions scandal. If there is no way to fix Volkswagen vehicles, the court may require the company to refund owners the difference between what they were told they were buying and what they received, Keating said. If there is a fix that makes the vehicles compliant with air regulations but compromises fuel economy or performance, the court may require compensation for the greater expense of operating the cars in addition to their loss in value, he added.

                <p>Edward McCaffery was quoted about the evolution of Tax Day. In 1954 the IRS reorganized and moved Tax day from March 15 to April 15. McCaffery said that pushing back the date allowed the government to hold onto tax money longer, because as the tax covered more of the middle class, the IRS needed to issue more refunds.</p>

"As efforts are made to assess the legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month, pundits have avoided discussing the one decision that stands as the biggest enigma in his corpus of largely conservative judicial decisions: Employment Division v. Smith, the historic case that repudiated the existence of a free exercise right to religious accommodation," Stolzenberg wrote. "Today, religious accommodation is championed by religious conservatives, who usually counted Justice Scalia as a friend, but remain mystified by what they perceive as his betrayal in Smith."

"That's the Republican Party, which is hurling toward disaster: Their only choice is to nominate a candidate who cannot win any votes among such key groups as African-Americans and Hispanics and who cannot win many votes among women. If the GOP doesn't nominate Trump, then they really will have an out-and-out civil war between now and the convention. The fact that Trump is doing so well in these Republican primaries and caucuses tells you as much about how unrepresentative they are as it does about how appealing Trump is."</p>

"Trump strikes fear into the heart of any American who believes our leader should not be the one to say out loud what we would rightly scold our children for saying (e.g., "I don't want any Muslims in my class" or "Mexicans are rapists"). Donald Trump is nothing so unusual: he is a demagogue, in the oldest tradition of divisive politics. He is preying on a system of minority rules that won't change until the general," Estrich wrote.

If it takes a slog to win this nomination, Clinton and her team will slog it out," Estrich wrote. "They will not make the mistake they made last time of ignoring some of the out-of-the way contests where a big win gets you a bigger margin than a closer race with many more delegates at stake. In other words, don't forget Wyoming."</p>

                <p>Judge Daniel Brenner, a lecturer at USC Gould, was tragically killed when he was hit by a car while crossing a street in Pico-Robertson. "He was a brilliant judge and lawyer and a beloved friend to many," said Judge Carolyn Kuhl, the presiding judge of the L.A. County Superior Court. "His death is a terrible loss for his family and the court." Brenner was appointed to the bench in 2012 after working as a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Hogan Lovells LLP. Added Gould Prof. Jonathan Barnett:  "Dan taught Communications Law for us for two years and it was a popular course in the Media, Entertainment & Technology program.  He had a mild-mannered and humorous teaching style, bringing alive a complex subject for our students. This is really sad news." His death was also reported by the Associated Press, National Law Journal, KTLA and Daily Journal, among others.</p>

He said it's hard to predict what the court will do in future cases without Scalia, but the justices have three options. "You could see the justices trying to compromise so that they can all agree on something narrow that would decide the case; you could see them just punting, giving it a 4-4 and letting it go away; and you could see them trying to send it to re-argument, saying we want to decide this but not until we have a full court," he said. Erman was also interviewed by CBS Los Angeles and KCBS Radio San Francisco.</p>

It remains to be seen whether those workers will be laid off or fired with cause. “If you’re replacing the people that you’re firing, it looks a whole lot less like a layoff. You are just getting rid of your poor performers and putting in stronger candidates,” Klerman said. “If there is a large number of employees separated for performance reasons at the same time and they are not replaced, that can start to look more like a layoff, where performance was the criteria.” </p>

"By beginning the process with small states that turn as much (or more, in the old days) on retail campaigning as television ads and news clips, the candidates get checked out up close and personal by real voters — before they enter the bubble from which the successful never emerge," Estrich wrote. "Yes, Iowa and New Hampshire are pretty much all white; meanwhile, Democratic victories depend on a coalition that includes Hispanics, African-Americans and organized labor more than family farmers, but that's pretty much how Nevada and South Carolina slip in."</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard was quoted in a column by Allan Sloan about a complicated deal involving U.S.-based Johnson Controls Inc. combining with Tyco International PLC, which is based in Ireland for tax purposes. The deal takes advantage of a loophole that gives the company more tax leeway if the shareholders of the U.S. company own between 50 and 60 percent of the combined company. “Congress drew the 60 percent line when it enacted the statute,” Kleinbard said. “There’s no fundamental economic explanation for that decision... . I am not aware of any history that explains why Congress drew the inversion line at 60 percent.”</p>

                <p>Susan Estrich wrote a column about recent news that presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz failed to report two loans he received for his 2012 Senate campaign. "Of course, there's nothing wrong with getting a loan to finance your campaign," Estrich wrote. "...But Goldman is the symbol of Wall Street excess, and Ted Cruz getting the rich guys' rate is not exactly the image he's trying to portray with Iowa only weeks away. Which brings me back to my point. Everything is going to come out. So if Cruz had told us himself, six months ago, when no one was paying attention, it would be old news, not a front-page story. Oh, the fun is just beginning — for the press, anyway."</p>

                <p>Robert Rasmussen co-authored an op-ed about Puerto Rico's options as a territory of the United States for restructuring its debt. "The Puerto Rico legislature could clarify that — in the context of a multicreditor debt issued by an entity that is not entitled to restructure its debts under the auspices of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code — the implicit duty of good faith in Puerto Rico law-governed contracts encompasses an obligation to cooperate with fellow lenders in that debt’s restructuring. That is, if future circumstances render normal performance impractical," Rasmussen wrote.</p>

                <p>Susan Estrich wrote a column about Hillary Clinton's disappearing lead in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. "There are two ways to win a nomination. One, the way you always dream of, is winning Iowa and New Hampshire and everyone else effectively is dead. That is what the Clinton campaign actually thought they could do last time," Estrich wrote. "The other, the one I have to believe the Clinton campaign is prepared for, is by grinding it out. You win the states no one else can afford to really contest. You score big among minority voters (not many in Iowa and New Hampshire), push your numbers among women and call in decades of chits (and good judgment) to win the support of all those super delegates who count in a grind."</p>

Guzman has been in office since the summer; however, that has not stopped him from creating and pushing for innovative programs at the USC Gould School of Law. Programs include a global network for law schools to be a part of and collaborate on. In addition, Guzman hopes to create a master's degree program that will allow non-lawyers to learn legal tools useful in business. According to Guzman, University leaders have been highly supportive of such ideas. "If we at the law school want to do something creative or innovative, the first instinct is not to shut it down," he said. "It is just the opposite." Despite the many challenges that face legal education, deans of law schools have an ever increasing opportunity to pursue new programs as well as wide-scale reform. </p>

                <p>USC Gould School's new program to help first-generation law students succeed was featured. The First Gen Program is similar to initiatives at Yale and Columbia University. "Law school is a mysterious place to people who have never been there. Our goal isn't to tell them how to study for this exam better," said USC Gould School Dean Andrew Guzman. "It's to make it clear they belong." About 40 students participated in this semester's program, said Camille Gear Rich, director of the program. The First Gen Program holds talks that encourage law students to have a "healthy sense of entitlement" and pushes them to interact with professors.</p>

                <p>Valerie Barreiro commented on a new study on self-harming images on Instagram. Barreiro said that social media companies have huge batches of content moving through their networks daily, and leaving it to users to report what bothers them helps companies manage the load. The firms also have to think about whether they want to be seen as subjectively deciding what is art versus something that might be offensive. “There’s a fine line between undue involvement and appropriately enforcing their guidelines,” Barreiro said.</p>

                <p>Heidi Rummel wrote an op-ed about the importance of DNA and video recordings for preventing wrongful convictions and holding law enforcement officials accountable in use-of-force cases. "These incidents demonstrate that we cannot blindly trust in the word of all law enforcement officers, especially in situations where the officers have strong incentives to lie," Rummel wrote. "In use of force cases, officers may lie to cover up their own misdeeds, avoid employment discipline, or criminal prosecution."</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard was quoted about corporate tax avoidance. "The right solution is worldwide tax consolidation at a fair rate," Kleibard said, which would prevent corporations from playing one country's tax regime off against another's. The reform could reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, Kleinbard said, but it would result in cleaner, fairer and more productive taxes. </p>

"...As Politico recently reported, Cruz's rise is driving desperate Republicans, especially senators, into the camp of Marco Rubio, who shares many of the same views as Cruz, but is, quite simply, not hated by his co-workers."</p>

Very few companies report foreign earning the way Pfizer does, in part because it lowers their reported earnings.

                <p>Susan Estrich wrote an op-ed arguing that Donald Trump has hit his ceiling with voters. "Trump is never going to win among women, or moderates, or minorities, or lots of other people who could cost him a general election or even a head-to-head primary. But when you’re talking about contests in which 27 percent makes you the frontrunner, and white males are predominating, yes, Trump can win Iowa," Estrich wrote. "And yes, I guess it’s true that if the race doesn’t get narrowed down soon enough, and if all the conventional candidates fall flat, it is even theoretically possible than Donald Trump could be the Republican nominee. But he will never win the presidency."</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard wrote an op-ed about a federal debt ceiling crisis that could be triggered in early November if what he called a "rudderless, riven and ineffective Congress" does not take action. "If triggered, a debt ceiling crisis would be a constitutional and fiscal nightmare of the first order," Kleinbard wrote. "From the time of Alexander Hamilton to today, this country has never dishonored its debts and other financial obligations, but that is exactly what a debt ceiling crisis would entail."</p>

                <p>Gregory Keating was quoted about how lawsuits brought against Volkswagen in the wake of its emissions scandal could force the company to buy back cars equipped with the test-rigging software. The plaintiffs make the case that the cars can't be driven legally since they violate pollution standards, Keating said. Even though the EPA says the cars can legally stay on the roads, eventually states with pollution tests will force owners to comply with the law, he added. "They can't give me the car that they told me I was buying, and they're forcing me to inflict environmental harm and be out of compliance with California law because of the wrong they committed," plaintiffs can argue, said Keating.</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard was interviewed on "Background Briefing with Ian Masters" about an impending debt ceiling crisis for the United States. "We have never in the 226-year history of the Republic, have never had an occasion on which the government of the United States has stood up and systematically dishonored its financial obligations," Kleinbard said. "That's what a debt ceiling crisis is saying, it's saying we will not pay our financial obligations, and that includes all forms of financial obligations, not just Tresury bonds, not just Social Security payments, but everything from rent to a landlord who's leasing property to the U.S. government, to military salaries for our men and women in service and salaries for every federal employee -- every financial disbursement by the government of the United States would in a sense now be called into question because the Treasury Department would not have the resources -- would not be permitted by Congress -- to borrow the funds necessary to pay those bills."</p>

"And so now the question becomes: can you as a member of that group, the group that’s been the butt of that word for 350 years, can you reappropriate it, invert it, and use it in your own way, either in an oppositional way or as a term of endearment?"</p>

                <p>Edwin Smith was cited about cases in which a home country may waive diplomatic immunity. Smith referenced a 1997 incident in which a Georgian diplomat killed a Maryland teenager in a car crash in Washington, D.C.. Smith said Georgia agreed to waive the man's immunity in order to preserve its good relations with the U.S., just years after the fall of the Soviet Union. The man was tried and sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison.</p>

                <p>Josh Lockman was interviewed about relations between the United States and Cuba. "It could be a stall; it also could just be a slow and steady climb," Lockman said. "In the wake of the rapprochement that has taken place and the seminal moment with the reopening of embassies, talks aren't proceeding as fast as people thought they were. That being said, progress has been made on trade issues and civil aviation agreements are underway. But there are many issues that President Obama and the White House simply cannot touch because of the U.S. embargo under Congressional control."</p>

"Politically relevant black urban poets and N-word virtuosos like Tupac Shakur, N.W.A, and Ice Cube vividly illustrate how people use words, sometimes the very same word, to embrace or push away, recognize or deny, others. In the hands of these profane poets, 'gangsta rap' is N-word-laden oppositional political discourse," Armour wrote.</p>

                <p>Dan Nabel was interviewed on "AirTalk" about a recent court decision in favor of a mother who received a DMCA takedown notice after posting a video to YouTube of her baby dancing to copyrighted music. "The tricky thing about fair use is that as technology changes, some of the hard questions in figuring out whether something is fair use can change too," Nabel said. "When we have questions about what's happening on YouTube, these are questions that didn't exist 20 years ago, so the law sometimes has to play catch-up in figuring out how to resolve these fair use questions."</p>

I think people believe that people with schizophrenia can't live independently and can't work and are going to basically sit in a day room watching a blaring TV at best, and at worst they're going to go out and shoot up a movie theater and kill lots of people. So there's a lot of negative stereotypes, and that's hard for those of us that suffer with those illnesses, to think 'Oh this person is scared of me, how horrible,'" Saks said. "I think we should provide people the treatment resources that will help them live full, whole and productive lives. We should educate the public about what mental illness looks like and how they can help. We should encourage people who start having symptoms to seek help, and for their friends to encourage them to seek help."</p>

He added that Trump has a long way to go in providing details, but that he "ought to be applauded for throwing out some ideas -- any ideas -- about fundamentally fixing America's flawed tax system. None of the many other Republican candidates seeking the presidency has done anything truly resembling that."</p>

                <p>Susan Estrich was interviewed about the controversy over Hillary Clinton's emails. "It's not killing her, but it's certainly not helping her," Estrich said. "The usual rule in politics is that when you've got a bad story ... like Geraldine Ferraro's taxes ... she had one big press conference with 20 years of tax returns and hundreds and hundreds of pages, and the whole thing went away in one day because there was nothing really there. The Clintons have adopted the diametrically opposite approach ... and for the life of me, I'm not sure I understand why."</p>

"None of those female migrants have ever mentioned the desire for birthright citizenship for their children as the reason for their decision to migrate to the U.S.," she said. "[I]nstead, lack of employment opportunities and/or violence in their home communities, and family reunification have been the most frequently cited reasons among my research subjects."</p>

"Judges, asylum officers, the U.S. government just don’t know what to make of gangs. The argument that a lot of advocates are making is that these are de facto governments," Frenzen said. "The legal protections that were drafted were drafted from a European perspective dealing with the post-World War II situation.

"The question, though, is did it do enough to tackle the problems of economic inequality, structural inequality, and it's subject to some criticisms there.

"Crime is real in the black community, and so police are wrestling with a real problem, but they're wrestling with it in a heavy-handed way from the community's standpoint. They're being overbroad, they're racially profiling, they're coming down on people who don't need to be come down on, and that has triggered the same kinds of tensions and rebellions from 50 years ago just a year ago with Ferguson."</p>

                <p>Jody Armour was interviewed about new legal developments regarding Bill Cosby and allegations of sexual assault. "It's going to have a huge impact. It corroborates the claims of plaintiffs and those who allege that they've been victimized by Bill Cosby," Armour said. "The [2005] deposition doesn't prove that he non-consensually gave women Quaaludes or any other drug as part of sex. But [it does] establish that he does mix sex and drugs and considers it a kind of acceptable and ordinary practice for him. It is powerfully corroborative of their essential claims that something like that may have gone on in their cases."</p>

                <p>David Cruz was interviewed on "Tavis Smiley" about the impact of a series of recent Supreme Court rulings, including decisions on same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act. "I think that it's going to be the highest salience, that the many candidates in the Republican field and the handful of Democratic candidates are going to be engaging with this. The further right a Republican candidate is going to be, the bigger a bulls-eye they're going to paint on the Supreme Court, due to decisions like the Obamacare decision and the decision for marriage for same-sex couples," Cruz said.</p>

                <p>Edward Kleinbard was cited about Chicago’s new tax on online services, including Netflix and other online providers of movies, music and games. Kleinbard said he had never heard of such a tax anywhere else in the United States. </p>

                <p>Elizabeth Armour was quoted about the decision by international firm Quinn Emanuel to drastically reduce its recruitment of rising 3L students for summer positions. Armour said because the firm only does litigation, it "has a different hiring profile" from many large law firms. It is looking "for more robust, mature skills" that take more time in law school or in clerkships to develop, she said.</p>
